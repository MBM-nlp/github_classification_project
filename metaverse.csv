# Introduction
Metaverse(MVS) is a decentralised system based on the blockchain technology, through which, a network of smart properties, digital identities and value intermediators are established.

**Metaverse Features**:
- [Digital Assets Register/Transfering](http://docs.mvs.org/whitepaper/index.html)
- [Digital Identity](http://docs.mvs.org/whitepaper/digital-identity.html)
- Oralces
- Decentralized Exchange

# Building MVS

## Compiler requirements
| Compilier | Minimum Version | Recommanded Version |
| ---------| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| gcc/g++ |   5.0             | 9.0.0+  |
| clang++ |   3.4 (8.0.0)     | 10.0.0+ |
| MSVC    |   19.0 (VS2015)   | VS2019  |

C++ compiler support [C++14](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) standard or newer.
Dependencies of MVS binaris are **static linked** (including libstdc++).

## Toolchain requirements
- cmake 3.0+
- git
- automake (speck256k1/ZeroMQ)

```bash
$ yum/brew/apt-get install git cmake
$ yum/brew/apt-get install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```


# Setup Library Dependencies

## By install_dependencies.sh
Installing `ZeroMQ` `secp256k1` automatically by:
```bash
$ sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
```
Installing `boost` `upnp` automatically by:
```bash
$ sudo ./install_dependencies.sh --build-boost --build-upnpc
```
## Manually
### boost 1.56+
```bash
$ sudo yum/brew/apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
[Download Boost 1.69.0](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.69.0/source/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz).

## zeromq 4.2.1+
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/download/v4.2.1/zeromq-4.2.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf zeromq-4.2.1.tar.gz
$ cd zeromq-4.2.1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
```
`server/explorer` requires ZeroMQ.

## secp256k1 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/secp256k1
$ cd secp256k1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-module-recovery
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
```

Sometimes we may got the following compile error `undefined reference to '__gmpn_sub_n' ...`
See more details here [#issue209](https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse/issues/209)
```
$ ./configure --enable-module-recovery --with-bignum=no
```

## miniupnpc
```bash
$ wget http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/miniupnpc-2.0.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf miniupnpc-2.0.tar.gz
$ cd miniupnpc-2.0
$ make -j4
$ sudo INSTALLPREFIX=/usr/local make install && sudo ldconfig
```
`blockchain/network` requires upnp if specified.

# Building
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse.git
$ cd metaverse && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DUSE_UPNP=OFF ..
$ make -j4
$ make install
```
To enable UPnP, use `cmake ..` instead.

optional:
```bash
$ make test (should install boost_unit_test_framework)
$ make doc  (should install doxygen and graphviz)
```

# Run it
 - **mvsd** - server program  
   Runs a full metaverse node in the global peer-to-peer network.

 - **mvs-cli** - client program  
   Sent your request to the server, the server will process it and return response to your client.

```bash
$ cd bin
$ ./mvsd
$ ./mvs-cli
$ ./mvs-cli getnewaccount -h
$ ./mvs-cli $command $params $options
```
Read More [Command line usage](https://docs.mvs.org/docs/command-line.html) and [Configuration file](https://docs.mvs.org/docs/config-file.html).

# Building/Run under docker

## Preparation
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
```
wget qO https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

## Build Metaverse docker image
```
git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse.git
cd metaverse
docker build -t metaverse -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Where is your built image? It’s in your machine’s local Docker image registry:
```bash
docker images
```

## Run && Test

### Start docker container
```bash
docker run -p 8820:8820 metaverse
```

### Test
```bash
curl -X POST --data '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""getinfo"",""params"":[],""id"":25}' http://127.0.0.1:8820/rpc/v2
```

### Execute mvs-cli commands
Run `mvs-cli` commands via `docker exec` command. Example:
```bash
docker exec metaverse mvs-cli getinfo
```

## Docker Compose

An example docker-compose file can be found at `docker/docker-compose.yml`.

``` bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
# OR
cd docker
docker-compose up -d

# Use CLI
docker-compose exec mvs-cli getheight
```

# Build for raspberry pi

Cross compile mvs using Docker in ubuntu 16.04

you need to change to **root** when executing the flowing command.

## env

check versin first, linux kerne and docker version:

```
host docker >= 17.05.0-ce
host kernel >= 4.8
```

install qemu:

```
apt-get install qemu-user-static
```

## way1

Clone the mvs source.
then enter mvs source directory, then run:

```
// for arm 64 (eg: aarch64, armv8(and abover))
sudo bash ./cross-build.sh arm64
```

When everything ok, the binary file and .so/.a file will be found in output directory.

- 10 GB Disk Space
- 8 GB RAM
- 4 Core CPU / vCPUs

## Installation

**Important note before you clone this repo:** This repo uses Git submodules.
You need to install with the `--recurse-submodules` flag or installation will not work. Copy the code below to clone the repository if you aren't sure.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/webaverse/app.git
cd app/ # Go into the repository
git pull --recurse-submodules # Pull recursively
npm install # Install dependencies
```

##### Note for Windows Users
We recommend that you use Windows Subsystem for Linux to run Webaverse. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RTSlby-l9w) shows you how you can set up WSL. Once you've installed it, run `wsl` in your terminal to enter Ubuntu, and then run Webaverse from there.

## Quickstart

Starting the application is as easy as:

```sh
npm run start
```

Once the server has started up, you can visit `https://local.webaverse.com` 

## Let's build it together!

We would love for you to come build with us. First, please review the documentation in it's entirety before contributing. Also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/webaverse) and introduce yourself.

##### New Issues and Features

Please search Github issues before reporting a new issue or starting a new feature. If you are starting a new feature or bug fix, please write up or reference an issue and indicate that you are working on it.

##### Pull Requests

Please make sure your PRs change as little existing code as is necessary to prevent upstream merge conflicts. When posting a pull request, please document what the PR does and how it can be reviewed and QA'd. PRs will be reviewed and accepted if they conform to our linting and code conventions, don't cause any bugs and don't decrease performance of the app.

## Our Goals
+ To provide benchmarks and facilitate fair comparisons, we allow researchers to evaluate different strategies on the same dataset. Also, it would help researchers to better understand the “black-box” nature (deep neural network-based) of DRL algorithms.
+ To reduce the simulation-reality gap: existing works use backtesting on historical data, while the actual performance may be quite different.
+ To reduce the data pre-processing burden, so that quants can focus on developing and optimizing strategies.

## Design Principles
+ **Plug-and-Play (PnP)**: Modularity; Handle different markets (say T0 vs. T+1)
+ **Completeness and universal:**
  Multiple markets; Various data sources (APIs, Excel, etc); User-friendly variables.
+ **Layer structure and extensibility**: Three layers including: data layer, environment layer, and agent layer. Layers interact through end-to-end interfaces, achieving high extensibility.
+ **“Training-Testing-Trading” pipeline**: simulation for training and connecting real-time APIs for testing/trading, closing the sim-real gap.
+ **Efficient data sampling**: accelerate the data sampling process is the key to DRL training!  From the ElegantRL project. we know that multi-processing is powerful to reduce the training time (scheduling between CPU + GPU).
+ **Transparency**: a virtual env that is invisible to the upper layer
+ **Flexibility and extensibility**: Inheritance might be helpful here

## Overview
![Overview image of FinRL-Meta](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Meta/blob/master/figs/neofinrl_overview.png)
We utilize a layered structure in FinRL-Meta, as shown in the figure above, that consists of three layers: data layer, environment layer, and agent layer. Each layer executes its functions and is independent. Meanwhile, layers interact through end-to-end interfaces to implement the complete workflow of algorithm trading. Moreover, the layer structure allows easy extension of user-defined functions.

## DataOps

DataOps applies the ideas of lean development and DevOps to the data analytics field. DataOps practices have been developed in companies and organizations to improve the quality and efficiency of data analytics. These implementations consolidate various data sources, unify and automate the pipeline of data analytics, including data accessing, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

However, the DataOps methodology has not been applied to financial reinforcement learning researches. Most researchers access data, clean data, and extract technical indicators (features) in a case-by-case manner, which involves heavy manual work and may not guarantee the data quality.

To deal with financial big data (unstructured), we follow the DataOps paradigm and implement an automatic pipeline in the following figure: task planning, data processing, training-testing-trading, and monitoring agents’ performance. Through this pipeline, we continuously produce DRL benchmarks on dynamic market datasets.

## Plug-and-Play (PnP)
In the development pipeline, we separate market environments from the data layer and the agent layer. A DRL agent can be directly plugged into our environments. Different agents/algorithms can be compared by running on the same benchmark environment for fair evaluations.

The following DRL libraries are supported:
+ [ElegantRL](https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/ElegantRL): Lightweight, efficient and stable DRL implementation using PyTorch.
+ [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3): Improved DRL algorithms based on OpenAI Baselines.
+ [RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray): An open-source DRL library that offers high scalability and unified APIs.

A demonstration notebook for plug-and-play with ElegantRL, Stable Baselines3 and RLlib: [Plug and Play with DRL Agents](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRL-Meta/blob/main/Demo_Plug_and_Play_with_DRL_Libraries.ipynb)

## ""Training-Testing-Trading"" Pipeline

<div align=""center"">
<img align=""center"" src=figs/timeline.png width=""80%"">
</div>

We employ a training-testing-trading pipeline. First, a DRL agent is trained in a training dataset and fine-tuned (adjusting hyperparameters) in a testing dataset. Then, backtest the agent (on historical dataset), or depoy in a paper/live trading market.

This pipeline address the **information leakage problem** by separating the training/testing and trading periods.

Such a unified pipeline also allows fair comparisons among different algorithms.


## Our Vision

For future work, we plan to build a multi-agent-based market simulator that consists of over ten thousands of agents, namely, a FinRL-Metaverse. First, FinRL-Metaverse aims to build a universe of market environments, like the XLand environment ([source](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/2021/open-ended-learning-leads-to-generally-capable-agents)) and planet-scale climate forecast ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03854-z)) by DeepMind. To improve the performance for large-scale markets, we will employ GPU-based massive parallel simulation just as Isaac Gym ([source](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10470)). Moreover, it will be interesting to explore the deep evolutionary RL framework ([source](https://doaj.org/article/4dd31838732842439cc1301e52613d1c)) to simulate the markets. Our final goal is to provide insights into complex market phenomena and offer guidance for financial regulations through FinRL-Meta.

# 1. Introduction

Metaverse Network is an EVM-enabled blockchain network for user-created metaverses and games.

Everyone can start their own metaverse for their people with the 3D world, NFTs, play-to-earn & build communities to
earn, and takes community engagement to a new dimension on web3.0.

# 2. Build

Install Rust and Wasm build environment:

```bash
make init
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
make build
```

# 3. Run

### Start a Dev Metaverse Network Chain

Start a dev Metaverse Chain

```bash
make run-dev
```

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables
set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -- --dev`.

This will spin up a Development Metaverse Chain with Alice and Bob as initial authorities.

If you would like to run multi-node manually then you can use the Multi-Node Dev Testnet setup

### Multi-Node Metaverse Network Chain

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two
validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain that have been endowed with
testnet units.

Optionally, give each node a name and expose them so they are listed on the
Polkadot [telemetry site](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Local%20Testnet).

You'll need two terminal windows open.

We'll start Alice's substrate node first on default TCP port 30333 with her chain database stored locally
at `/tmp/alice`. The bootnode ID of her node is `QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR`, which is generated
from the `--node-key` value that we specify below:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --base-path /tmp/alice \
  --chain=local \
  --alice \
  --node-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

In the second terminal, we'll start Bob's substrate node on a different TCP port of 30334, and with his chain database
stored locally at `/tmp/bob`. We'll specify a value for the `--bootnodes` option that will connect his node to Alice's
bootnode ID on TCP port 30333:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --base-path /tmp/bob \
  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR \
  --chain=local \
  --bob \
  --port 30334 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

🗓️[OMI Calendar](#calendar) | [OMI Website](https://omigroup.org)

The Open Metaverse Interoperability Group is focused on bridging virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more. Our members include businesses and individuals working towards this common goal. Aside from technical work, OMI aims to create a community of artists, creators, developers, and other innovators to discuss and explore concepts surrounding the design and development of virtual worlds.

## OMI Core Values

- We collaborate, driven by research, privacy and accessibility, to make the metaverse more human.
- We work incrementally, iteratively, and with intent. 
- We are creating a cooperative, sustainable culture of innovation. 
- We empower the people making the metaverse.
- We must cultivate resiliency by championing diversity, and freedom of choice.

## Our Vision
>## We bolster the metaverse as an open and interoperable resource for anyone, inspired by the collaborative efforts of the community.

## Community Meetup

We have a weekly meeting every Wednesday at 16:00 UTC in the omi-weekly-meeting channel of the [AngellXR / OMI Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E).
Agendas and meeting notes can be found in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup/discussions/categories/weekly-meetings).
Informal discussions also take place on discord ([join our Discord](https://discord.gg/NJtT9grz5E)).

If want to catch up on topics, ask questions, or discuss new ideas we encourage you contribute to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/omigroup/OMIgroup/discussions) and come to [one of our meetings](#active+subgroups)!

## FAQ

### Are you really trying to build the Metaverse?

No. Any one group, be it a company or organization cannot build the metaverse. With OMI we hope to form consensus around ways we can turn siloed virtual worlds into a network of interoperable worlds. People have very different ideas of what their worlds should look like and how they should operate. It's not our job to tell them how to create their worlds. We aim to bring world builders together and create protocols so that traversing the metaverse is as seamless as possible.

# MyETPWallet
This is the Metaverse lightwallet. Main focus so far is to have a wallet that does not need to download the full Metaverse blockchain. The private key gets generated and encrypted in the browser and gets never exposed to any server. Transactions get signed locally and only the signed, encoded transactions get broadcasted to the network. The lightwallet can also be build as a mobile app as well as a browser extension.

## Install Dependencies
As this webapp is made with ionic framework you should install the ionic cli as well as the other npm dependencies.
```bash
npm install -g ionic
npm install
```

## How to start it?
You can then just use ionic to generate a live preview.
```
ionic serve
```
Or on your android phone. Make sure you have an android development environment with build-tools and sdk with accepted licenses.
```
ionic capacitor copy android && cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug && ./gradlew installDebug && cd ..
```

## How to build it?

```
ionic build --engine=browser --prod
```

To build it for Android you can use this command:
```
ionic capacitor build android --prod
```

pentaho/pentaho-metaverse,Java,"#pentaho-metaverse

This project defines implementations and interfaces for use with the Pentaho Metaverse, which provides the following capabilities:

- Data Lineage
- Impact Analysis
- Metadata auditing/governance
- Provenance diagnostics (missing links, references, files, etc.)


### How to build this project
*This is a maven-based project so you must have it available on your system.*

**Typical build.** This will compile the code, run the unit tests, and assemble a Pentaho platform-plugin in the `target` folder.
```
mvn install
```

**Compile only.**
```
mvn compile
```

**Run the unit tests.**
```
mvn test
```

**Run the integration tests.**
```
mvn integration-test
```

**Run the unit tests with code coverage.** This will output an html report here: `target/site/cobertura/index.html`
```
mvn clean compile test-compile cobertura:cobertura
```

**Run checkstyle against the code.** This will output an html report here: `target/site/checkstyle.html`
```
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```

**Maven command line switches to get familiar with**

- `-o, --offline` Work offline
- `-D, --define` Defines a system property. One particularly useage of this iw when you don't want the unit tests to run. To do that, just define the skipTests property
```
mvn install -DskipTests
```
- `-U, --update-snapshots` Forces an update for releases and snapshots from remote repository

##### Other build tips
The default profile when building is ""production"". When that profile is active, the install goal will also obfuscate the artifact. To force this to the development profile where obfuscation is not run, you have 3 options...
- set the active profile on the commandline
```
mvn install -P development
mvn install -P production
```
- activate the profile with the ""env"" property setting
```
mvn install -Denv=dev
mvn install -Denv=prod
```
- activate the profile in your <user home>/.m2/settings.xml file using the env property
```xml
<settings xmlns=""http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance""
  xsi:schemaLocation=""http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.1.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.1.0.xsd"">

  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>

      <properties>
        <env>dev</env>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```

# 像素元宇宙

## 像素元宇宙简介：

像素元宇宙是一个百分百由玩家自主绘制的世界，在元宇宙中，每个居民都可以将现实中的一切进行复制和克隆。宇宙居民不受随机数的约束，可以自主决定自己的宇宙身份、外貌、装备以及资产等。宇宙中有各种身份和职能供居民选择，如他们可以选择医生、警察或者商人等等。作为医生，他可以改变居民的性别或者是样貌。作为商人，他可以制作眼镜、口罩、帽子等等产品进行出售。

## 像素元宇宙特点

* 高度自治化: 像素元宇宙是一个高度自治且去中心化的，用户所有资产都是在链上，不可篡改和伪造。所有资产不存储于任何中心化的服务器，仅仅在区块链获取到数据后通过开源的前端UI组件即可绘制用户的区块链身份等信息，不与任何资源链接做绑定。

* 万物资产化: 像素元宇宙合约继承了ERC721标准的所有接口和功能，所有资产均可全链流通。宇宙中所有物品、器官、资产等都是ERC721标准的TOKEN，宇宙中的一切都进行了TOKEN化。

* 资产乐高化: 用户可通过合约来重组配置自己，重组性特别强。制作的产品越精细，可组合性越强，宇宙越清晰越丰富，是真正的实现了NFT碎片化。

* 宇宙层级化: 像素元宇宙分为5个层级，每个层级都是一个独立的合约，所有资产又同处于一个ERC721合约。每个层级的居民有不同的行为和样式。如层次分明层宇宙的居民只有有跑跳等功能，而洞察秋毫层宇宙却可以进行竞技类游戏。宇宙可支持像素越细，宇宙功能则会越丰富。宇宙不断社会化，发展越趋近于现实世界。

## 像素元宇宙现状和未来

当前元宇宙已在原来的头像绘制的基础上升级为万物合成阶段。当前居民可以上传任何物品图片，通过算法生成像素画。并通过对该像素画的复制来生成和发行该像素部位对应的资产。

当前宇宙初始有10000个原始居民名额，是为创世像素元宇宙居民。当宇宙升级到渺若烟云层时，也就是可绘制身体以及四肢时。原始居民可以选择自己的职业和性别或身份，在选择一定时间后可以通过男女配对来生育子女，每个子女成人后也可以通过配对生育他们的子女。宇宙总人口1024000，直到达到宇宙总人口便不
再新增居民。

最高层级的元宇宙可以体验到大部分现实世界的生活，居民可通过木工身份来建造宇宙的房屋和家具等等，而出租车司机可以通过自身携带的属性将居民快速的送往目的地，而没有交通工具的居民仅仅只能花费更多的时间和精力。居民可以体验生老病死、富贵美丑等，满足你内心深处对于自己理想身份的所有幻想。

未来宇宙的场景可以很丰富，这一切都是在所有居民共同作用下实现的。所以，加入像素元宇宙吧，让我们去创建自己的宇宙。在像素元宇宙的世界里，自由翱翔吧。


## 项目启动
```sh
1. yarn
2. yarn compile
3. yarn test
4. yarn deploy1 --network kovan
5. yarn abi:api
6. modify source:
      address: ""new address""
      abi: PixelsMetaverse
      startBlock: new block
7. yarn graph-codegen
8. yarn graph-build
9. 发布至graph
```

> 当前项目基于truffle框架开发，如果仅仅只是查看项目可无需安装，若需重新部署合约，则需要安装truffle，具体可参考该[truffle框架文档](https://learnblockchain.cn/docs/truffle/index.html)

> 合约部署后需要设置721合约token的发行者，可自行编写代码调用接口，或者是安装 [contract-json-converted-html](https://github.com/xiangzhengfeng/truffle-contract-json-converted-html) npm包，将truffle生成的智能合约json文件直接转换成html文件，可以自动生成可视化的页面进行调用和查看数据。

> 新版本暂未在其他网络部署合约，仅在自己本地部署了。故其他开发者 <strong>yarn start</strong> 后的合约地址是无效的，此时可以通过truffle部署在本地或者其他网络便可，部署成功后，将部署后的新合约地址新增到 <strong>converted.config.js</strong> 中即可。

## 当前任务
1. 将该truffle框架升级为hardhat
2. 将webjs和自己编写的交互逻辑改为开源的web3-react。


## react-pixels-metaverse
项目中将所有绘制进行了封装和抽离，任何项目方或网站都可以安装 [react-pixels-metaverse](https://github.com/UniqueDAO/react-pixels-metaverse) 该npm包，并在自己的项目中引入UI组件，传入用户地址或身份数据即可生成他的像素元宇宙身份图案。

Menithal/Blender-Metaverse-Addon,Python,"# Blender Metaverse Toolkit Blender Add-on (MVT) AddOn

Plugin (""Project Hermes"") is a plugin for Blender to allow for easier content creation originally created for importing for the High Fidelity Metaverse Platform. 

It has now being expanded to support additional platforms. as the official High Fidelity platform is turning off, while its forks are going to live their separate lives.
This plugin now will focus on supporting as many platforms as possible.

Currently Supports

- HiFi and Forks
- VRC (NeosVR by Proxy)
- Tower Unite
- Faceshift/Animaze

## 3.1+ Works with blender 2.90 or later.

# Installation Guide

## Simple
Open the Github page, go to releases and download the `metaverse_tools.zip` zip file. 

In Blender. Goto `User Preferences`, and `Add-ons`. From there `Install Add-on from File` and select the Zip file that we downloaded.

Enable the plugin under `Import-Export: Metaverse Toolkit Blender Add-on`.

### If you had previous used plugin when it was ""High Fidelity"" Only, make sure to uninstall the old one first.

## If you use the git repository:

Make sure to `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` as we are using an external add on to bind shapekeys to new model.

Copy `metaverse_tools` folder to your Blender Addons Directory. 

On Windows this is under `%APPDATA%/Blender Foundation/Blender/<BlenderVersion>/addons`


# Utility Functions:

### General Tools

- Material Tools
   - Automatic `Principled BDSF` binding to HF FBX. You can use Blender materials to define HF materials, just do not use Node Groups.
   - `Set Non-Diffuse ColorData` and `Auto Correct on Save` Tools that fixes color spaces for Roughness, Normal, and Metallic textures for preview
   - `Textures to Mask` and `Textures to Png` utility helpers.
- Mesh Tools:
    - `Merge Modifiers & Shapekeys` attempt to merge modifiers onto Mesh with Shapekeys using Przemysław Bągard's ApplyModifierForObjectWithShapeKeys script, now included with this plugin, but if an existing copy exists, it is used instead
    - `Clean Unused Vertex Groups` Clean model from vertex groups that are not in its current skeleton.
- Armature Tools:
    - `Test Avatar Rest Pose` - Attempts to detect type of skeleton and applies an absolute T-Pose by the platform reference
    - `Merge Bones` - Attempts to merge selected bones to last selected bone.
    - `Match Reference Rolls` - Uses rolls from the detected reference skeleton.


### High Fidelity Tools

Generic Toolset allowing one to create content for High Fidelity forks, from 

- A new Panel on the `3D View`'s right tool set is added, labled `MVT: High Fidelity`
- Armature Tools
    - `Add Hifi Armature` - Adds an Armature which is compatible with High Fidelity forks, has all the naming conventions in place
    - `Set Bone Physical` - (Armature Edit mode only) Adds a prefix to selected bones for Scripts in High fidelity for physical simulation
    - `Remove Bone Physical` - (Armature Edit mode only) Removes prefix from selected bones for Scripts in High fidelity for physical simulation
- Avatar Converters
    - `Custom Avatar` - Attempts to bind of the model to a HF specific Bone naming and rotations.
    - `MMD Avatar` - Translates and fixes MMD models and their materials for them to work in High Fidelity. [Full MMD Avatar import tutorial here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJX8VUPZLKQ)


#### Hifi Export Tools:

- `File > Export > Hifi FBX`: Custom FBX that binds to the `Principled BDSF` into a format HiFi understands
- `File > Export > Hifi Avatar FST`: Exports Avatar, applies necessary steps for avatar to work in High Fifelity. 
   - Supports Embedded textures: Exports Textures embedded to file
   - Supports Selected Only: Exports Selected only
   - Experimental Oven Feature:  Experimental feature to Compress Avatar and its Textures: Only settable if you have set the path under `User Settings > Addon > HiFi Blender Add-on`
- `File > Export > HiFi Metaverse Scene JSON/FBX`: Exports Scene as a json and Fbx
    - Marketplace / Base URL : This is the folder path for your marketplace or external server address. Simply paste the directory where you will upload the files here, and the json file will have the urls automatically appended to them. This is not optional and must be set prior to exporting: You will otherwise have an error message
    - Clone Scene prior to export

#### Importing from Hifi:
The add-on allows you to import **primitive entities**  from High Fidelity. In High Fidelity,  select the entities you want to export and press export. 

In Blender, You can then import these entities with `File > Import > HiFi Metaverse Scene JSON`

You can then set materials to the objects via the material panel, modify the mesh, do uv mapping corrections.

#### Hifi Import Settings

- Use UV Sphere: Instead of a Quad sphere, use a UV sphere for the base primitive
- Join Mesh Children: If Boolean is set to None, join Children with their Parents into a Single Mesh
- Merge Distance: Set this higher if you want to remove doubles
- Delete interior faces: If the mesh is enclosed and not consisting of multiple convex intercepting shapes, delete interior walls 
- Boolean: Experimental feature to enable
    - None: Use no boolean solver to solve for faces
    - BMesh: Experimental: Use BMesh solver to solve for mesh
    - Carve: Experimental Use Carge solver to solve for mesh

If Entity is not Child of another entity, no Join is done. Only Children are merged with their Parents

Note that Boolean operations work differently, and some may not keep the UV Unwrapping correctly in some situations. Use at your own risk


### VRChat / Neos Tools (WIP) 

Work in progress module to try to stream line some ""gotchas"" when converting avatars to VRC without the duplicate operator additions from CATS (creating operators for Tools that are already in Blender, which create abit of clutter during operator searches). Also by proxy supports NeosVR, which automatically binds the visemes when fbx export is used.

- A new Panel on the `3D View`'s right tool set is added, labeled `MVT: VRC Tools`
- Armature Tools

OpenCollar/opencollar,LSL,"### Welcome to OpenCollar Six™

OpenCollar Six is a set of LSL scripts and other creative content, such as animations, sounds, textures, graphics and 3D models, which can be used to create role play devices in the form of scripted accessory and/or so-called HUDs.

Punk, goth and fetish collars would be the most popular of those and OpenCollar eventually became everyone's script set of choice to create items that are used for creative role play amongst adults in Second Life®.

#### Finding your way around this repo

At the moment this repository is separated into resources, source code and web queries. The directory names are self-explanatory and each has a readme attached that tells about specific details. Resource subdirectories inform which file formats we work with and point to other free software that can be used to create such content.

# What can I do in lemverse?

## Tileset Editor

In order to be able to create your own universe, you will need some tilesets.  
We recommend using tileset of 16x16 pixels.

To upload a new tileset, visit the url `http://localhost:3000/editor` or `http://lemverse.example.com/editor`.
ℹ️ Only people with `admin` role can access this page.

Here are the description of all parts:  
<img alt=""login"" src=""./app/public/tileset-editor.png"">

1. As stated, you drag and drop your image file(s) to upload them.
2. This part is just a reminder about the index of the layers for all tiles.
   - Player are between layer `5` and `6`.
   - Default index is `2` and not displayed.
3. This is the list of all tilesets.
   - You can either remove the tileset with hitting the cross
   - Rename it, by double clicking on it
4. The view of the tileset
   - When you are over a tile, simply hit a number from `0` to `8` to change the layer
   - Layer `2` is the default and thus is not displayed
   - Hit `c` to change the tile to be a collision tile (will be displayed in red)

Once you have imported the tileset and do some tweak about collision and layering, you can begin to create your universe!

## Character Editor

This editor takes place at the same place as the tilesets editor.

To add a new resource, simply drag & drop over the page.

Here are the description of all parts:  
<img alt=""login"" src=""./app/public/character-editor.png"">

1. Different type of filter to change the dropdown
2. Here are the list of all resources available in the current category
3. Display of the character part to help you figure out how to categorize it.
4. The five possible categories to change the part.

## Edit your universe!

For editing the universe you need to have the right to do so. Luckily for you, outside of production anybody can do it!

To move to the editor mode, simply it `e` and you should see it!

### Level edit

Once you hit `e` you will see something like this:  
<img alt=""login"" src=""./app/public/level-editor.png"">

Here are the description of all parts:

1. All tiles that you can select. Move your mouse over them and click to select.
   - Once it's done, you can click on the map to paste it.
   - You can also select multiple tiles at the same time!
2. You did mess up and want to clean up things?
   - You can hit `cmd+z` to undo what you just did.
   - Or use the `eraser` tool to remove one layer (shortcut from `0` to `8`) or hit `c` to remove all layers upon selection.
3. It's the dropdown of all your tilesets. You can select another one to be able to copy/paste others tiles.
4. Information about your current pointer on map.
   - You have the position
   - Information about the different tiles on each layers (useful to use the right `eraser` layer)

### Zone edit

Once you hit `e` again you will see something like this:  
<img alt=""login"" src=""./app/public/zone-editor.png"">

You can add a zone then select on the map the top left followed by the bottom right corner of the new zone.

If you want to edit a zone, simply click on either corner coordinate then click on the map.

> ℹ️ Press ""alt"" or ""option"" during edition to snap world coordinates to tiles coordinates

Each zone can be configured to make more things.  
To edit those information, simply click on the name of the room (bold text).

```jsonc
{
  ""adminOnly"": false|true, // Put true to restrict the zone to administrators
  ""name"": ""PianoSession"", // Name displayed when you enter in the zone
  ""hideName"": false|true, // Shows/hides the name of the zone when the user enters it
  ""roomName"": """", // Open a jitsi room with the given name, leave empty to do nothing
  ""teleportEndpoint"": """", // Coordinate ""640,480"" where unauthorized people will be teleported once enter restricted zone
  ""unmute"": false|true, // Automatically unmute jitsi mic (useful to unmute people on platform in conference room)
  ""unhide"": false|true, // Automatically show cam in jitsi (useful to show people face automatically on platform in conference room)
  ""url"": ""https://mczak.com/code/piano/pianoframe"", // If present, this will popup an iframe with this url inside
  ""fullscreen"": false|true, // Set the iframe if full screen or not
  ""targetedLevelId"": """", // Used for teleport zone. Should be the id of the level to teleport to.,
  ""inlineURL"": ""https://status.lemlist.com|<p>My custom text</p>"", // Pop-in content with URL or HTML content
  ""disableCommunications"": false|true, // Disabling all communications for the user inside the zone
  ""yt"": false|true, // If the ""url"" attribute is a YouTube video it allows its integration without blocking
  ""requiredItems"": [""itm_x"", ""itm_y""], // Items required to enter the zone
  ""spawn"": false|true, // Mark this zone as the starting zone, users will be able to enter the level from here
  ""popInConfiguration"": {
    ""position"": ""top"", // Optional: Pop-in position on the zone (center, left, right, bottom or top), set ""relative"" for custom position using ""x"" & ""y"" (default center)
    ""x"": 0, // Optional: Relative position from the zone's center on X (you need to set ""position"" to ""relative"")
    ""y"": -60, // Optional: Relative position from the zone's center on Y (you need to set ""position"" to ""relative"")
    ""width"": 120, // Optional: Custom width
    ""height"": 45, // Optional: Custom height
    ""className"": ""wood-style welcome with-arrow tooltip acid fade-in animated-text"" // Optional: List of CSS classes to customize pop-in's style
  }
}
```

### Entity edit

An entity is something dynamic outside the map that can be interacted with and animated unlike the world map.

It is possible to do many things with it like :

- Create doors
- Add unique/customized elements
- Create interactions
- ...

For game developers, an entity should be seen as a simple identifier on which components are added.

For the moment it is possible to create entities only from a JSON configuration, some parameters can be modified directly with an interface.

Here is the structure of a basic JSON for a door:

```jsonc
{
  // Main data
  ""_id"": ""ent_x"",
  ""name"": ""Door"",
  ""levelId"": ""lvl_z"",
  ""x"": 0,
  ""y"": 0,

  // 0 = no action / 1 = actionable / 2 = pickable (will be stored in the user inventory)
  ""actionType"": 0,

  // optional: Linked entity, useful to create triggers
  ""entityId"": ""ent_y"",

  // States available (optional)
  ""state"": ""off"",
  ""states"": {
    ""off"": {
      ""animation"": ""close"", // animation to play when entering this state
      ""collider"": {
        ""enable"": true // enable the collider
      }
    },
    ""on"": {
      ""animation"": ""open"",
      ""collider"": {
        ""enable"": false
      }
    }
  },

  // Entity representation in the simulation (optional)
  ""gameObject"": {
    ""scale"": 1,

    // Sprite component (optional)
    ""sprite"": {
      ""key"": ""image_unique_id"",
      ""path"": ""image_url|sprite_sheet_url"",
      ""frameWidth"": 32, // optional: set frame width on the spritesheet
      ""frameHeight"": 48 // optional: set frame height on the spritesheet
    },

    // Animation component (optional)
    ""animations"": {
      ""open"": {
        ""repeat"": 0,
        ""start"": 0,
        ""end"": 5
      },
      ""close"": {
        ""repeat"": 0, // -1 to animate endlessly, 0 to animate once, x to animate x times
        ""start"": 5, // starting animation on the
        ""end"": 0 // ending frame
      }
    },

    // Physics component (optional)
    ""collider"": {
      ""radius"": 15, // use ""radius"" to create a circle. Use ""width"" and ""height"" to create a rectangle
      ""offsetX"": -15, // collider offset on X
      ""offsetY"": -30, // collider offset on Y
      ""immovable"": false, // static or dynamic physic body
      ""dragX"": 0.05, // drag on x = ""friction""/velocity slowdown speed
      ""dragY"": 0.05, // drag on y = ""friction""/velocity slowdown speed
      ""collideTilemap"": true // enable or disable collision with walls
    }
  }
}
```

## Shortcuts in lemverse

In lemverse you have only few but useful shortcuts!

### Who's here and where?

What to know more about the `explorers` in the same universe?  
Hit `Tab` and you will see them! And maybe ghosts...

<img alt=""login"" src=""./app/public/tab.png"">

Only `admin` can see others admin (with the 👑).  
You can allow other users to edit your universe by clicking on the hammer and spanner 🛠.

### Reactions

If you want to use pre-defined reactions, you can hit from `1` to `5` and it will display an emoji on top of your character.  
If you want to use a custom one, go to the settings to add one, and use `l` to activate it!

### Share what you want!

Activating camera, sharing screen can be annoying with the mouse itself, so simply use `shift`+`1` (to `4`) to switch the state of the options.

### Editing the level

Like describe in a previous part, we must use `e` to launch the edit mode.

### Shout to your surrounding!

Like in real life, you can shout around you.  
We restricted this to the zone you are currently in.

To do so, simply hit `r` and speak!  
Once you finished, just release the touch and your message will be send to everybody and play instantly.

### Leave a message!

It may happen that a user isn't available to chat. Fortunately, it's possible to leave a message for the user.

The use is very simple, you just have to go near the person to whom you want to leave a message and then press the `p` key, speak and release the key.

The user will then receive a notification.
You can also open your notification list and listen to old messages using `cmd/ctrl + 5`.

## How to create a new universe?

To create a new universe you need to add a document in the `levels` collection.

Simply run the following command in your browser console:

```js
Levels.insert({ _id: Levels.id(), name: ""My test universe"" });
```

For the `level` structure, here are an explanation of all fields:

```jsonc
{
  ""_id"": ""lvl_XXXXXXXX"", // Id of the level (useful for TP)
  ""name"": ""My test universe"", // Name of your universe
  ""spawn"": {
    // Spawn position in level
    ""x"": 42,
    ""y"": 7
  },
  ""skins"": {
    ""guest"": {
      // Guest Avatar
      ""body"": ""chr_11111111111111111"", // Id ""characters"" collection
      ""accessory"": ""chr_22222222222222222"", // Id in ""characters"" collection (Optional)
      ""hair"": ""chr_33333333333333333"", // Id in ""characters"" collection
      ""eye"": ""chr_44444444444444444"", // Id in ""characters"" collection
      ""outfit"": ""chr_55555555555555555"" // Id in ""characters"" collection
    },
    ""default"": {
      // Default Avatar when user create account
      ""body"": ""chr_11111111111111111"", // Id ""characters"" collection
      ""accessory"": ""chr_22222222222222222"", // Id in ""characters"" collection (Optional)
      ""hair"": ""chr_33333333333333333"", // Id in ""characters"" collection
      ""eye"": ""chr_44444444444444444"", // Id in ""characters"" collection
      ""outfit"": ""chr_55555555555555555"" // Id in ""characters"" collection
    }
  }
}
```

You can use the level id everywhere it's useful, like in the `defaultLevelId` property in `settings.json` (More information bellow).

## Tell me more about `settings.json`!

This file regroup all information about the settings.  
Please note, that as stated in section `Deploy in production`, there is an additional file with sensitive information that will me merge with the one in the repository.

# Getting started!

Once you have cloned the repo:

- Install system dependencies:
  - [Meteor](https://docs.meteor.com/install.html) (you will need to [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you are using Windows)
  - GraphicsMagick (most likely available in your package manager, e.g. `brew install graphicsmagick`)
- Go to `./app/`
- Install JS dependencies: `meteor npm install`
- Run the app: `meteor --settings settings-dev.json`

The app should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`, and MongoDB at `mongodb://localhost:3001/meteor`.

## LocalTunnel to debug with other computers

Webrtc is working when on localhost, but if you want to test with another computer you need to have an HTTPS connection.  
You will need to use a tunnel to expose you laptop over internet.

We decided to use [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).  
Once it's installed on an accessible server, setup env variable `LT_DOMAIN` without http(s) so just the domain.

After that, simply launch `ROOT_URL=https://lemverse-$(whoami).${LT_DOMAIN} meteor --settings settings-dev.json`.

Modify `createMyPeer` in `peer.js` to change the host to `lemverse-peer-USER-DOMAIN` while `USER`=`whoami` and `DOMAIN`=`LT_DOMAIN` env variable.

Access to your local instance at: `https://lemverse-USER-DOMAIN`.

> :warning: Don't forget to change the port to 443 for peers when using local tunnel

## First login

Simply create your account and voila!  
You now have a nice player with everything is black!

The first user will always be an admin and so has the right to edit the level by pressing `E`.
If you are not the first user, you are not admin, and so you can not change anything 😭.  
Let's change that!

Execute this command and you should become admin:

```js
remote(
  `Meteor.users.update(Meteor.userId(), { $set: { roles: { admin: true } }})`
);
```

Now enjoy the possibility to edit by simply pressing `E` on you keyboard (see more detail below).

ℹ️ In production, to execute the `remote` command you need to add yourself (`Meteor.userId()`) in the admin array in `settings.json` (something like `usr_XXXXXX`) or hide it in the `/usr/local/etc/lemverse.json` (Server side only!).

## Roles

In lemverse you have different roles:

- `Guest`: Can move everywhere but can not talk, share screen nor listen
- `User`: Can move everywhere except admin zone (`adminOnly=true`), talk, listen, share screen
- `Editor`: Same as `User` but can also edit the level
- `Admin`: Same as `Editor` (for all levels) but can go to every zones and give people `Editor` roles (Through UI)
- `God`: Same as `Admin` but can also run `remote` command from the console

# Deploy in production!

## Docker images

### Official image

The official lemverse image is `lempire/lemverse`.  
If you want to pull the last version, you should do:  
`docker pull lempire/lemverse:latest`

### Build

#### Production

To build the latest version of lemverse, simply run the following command:  
`docker build . -t lempire/lemverse:latest`

#### Development

To build from you source without having to install anything, you can run the following command:

`docker build -f Dockerfile.dev . -t lempire/lemverse:dev`

Or run the full dev env with hot reload: `docker-compose up -d`  
It take a while to start the server.
Then every change in the project will be automatically reloaded.

### Deploy

Visit `example/docker-compose-prod` to find the deployment instructions with `docker-compose` stack.

## Slack Notification upon deployment

To have a slack notification, you need to install the [slack cli](https://github.com/rockymadden/slack-cli) on the workstation from which you will deploy.

You should also have an environment variable `LEMVERSE_CHANNEL`

# Useful commands/tricks

## Beta flag

If you want to add feature either not completely finished or just to test for few users, you should use `beta flags`.

To use the beta flag, you have one function `isLemverseBeta` which can be called either in `.hbs` file as is or in `.js` with `lp.isLemverseBeta('myBetaFlag')`.

The beta flag are stored in an array named `beta` inside each document in `users` collection.

## Maintenance aka Import/Export data

### Export

Since the data is stored in mongo database, you can simply use the command:

```bash
mongoexport --db lemverse --collection=tilesets --jsonArray --out lemverse-tilesets.json
```

### Import

To import a saved collection, use the following command to import it:

```bash
mongoimport --db=lemverse --collection=tilesets --host=localhost --port=9001 --file=./lemverse-tilesets.json --drop --jsonArray
```

The command will replace the current `tilesets` collection with the data inside the file.

## `remote` command

Within your browser, you can safely (`god` only) execute command in your backend.

We provide a command named `remote` that will pass the content to the backend to be executed with `eval`.

For example, to add a beta flag to yourself execute this command in your browser:

```js
remote(
  ""Meteor.users.update({ _id: Meteor.userId() }, { $addToSet: { 'beta': { $each: ['myAwesomeFeature'] } } });""
);
```

## Custom avatars

It's possible to modify the avatars displayed during a discussion using an image API. To do so, you just have to modify the `settings.json` file.

You can add dynamic parameters to your URL using `[user_id]` or `[user_name]` to access id and name of the user who requests an avatar.

Website with images API :

- [Unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com)
- [Robohash](https://robohash.org)

> Example with Robohash: `https://robohash.org/[user_name]?set=set4&bgset=bg2&size=320x240`

# Assets

We use paid assets from [limezu](https://limezu.itch.io/) on [itch.io](https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors).

By default lemverse appears in black because you have no textures in the project, you must go to the editor to upload the different textures.

## Panaverse Certified Web 3.0 and Metaverse Developer Tranining Program

The internet is undoubtedly the most significant technological development in human history. Although the industry has progressed immensely since its inception, we are just scratching the surface of what it can do for us. Web3 and metaverse technologies improves the internet as we know it today by adding innovative new features and enhancements. The metaverse reimagines the frontend, and web3 the backend of the web. Web 3.0 and the Metaverse will work together and complement each other in the future. Whereas Web 3.0 is primarily concerned with who will own and rule the internet of the future, the metaverse concept is concerned with how users will interact with it. When the metaverse world would come to fruition, it may be centralised (as in Web 2.0), decentralised (as in Web 3.0), or a hybrid of the two. In any case, it is likely that the world will be powered by NFTs (i.e. unique tokens).

Citi is the latest Wall Street firm to issue a bullish forecast for web3 and the metaverse, which describe a future internet vision based on decentralised technologies and virtual worlds. Citi said in a [research report published in March 2022](https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/metaverse-and-money/) that the metaverse economy could have a <strong>total addressable market of up to $13 trillion and can capture five bullion users by 2030</strong>. We suggest you download the Citi's research report from [here](https://ir.citi.com/gps/x5%2BFQJT3BoHXVu9MsqVRoMdiws3RhL4yhF6Fr8us8oHaOe1W9smOy1%2B8aaAgT3SPuQVtwC5B2%2Fc%3D)

This program focuses on developing full-stack Web 3.0 and Metaverse experiences for the next generation of the internet by specializing in building worlds that merge the best of cutting-edge decentralized distributed blockchains with 3D metaverse client experiences (including Web 2.0 centralized serverless cloud technologies). 

After completing this program you will be able to develop 2D and 3D experiences that scale instantly to support even the most demanding applications, while at the same time delivering up to 90% cost savings. This stack which will be covered in this program is ideal for a broad set of applications. For example, enterprises that have hundreds of thousands of applications, or software as a service (SaaS) vendors that have multi-tenant environments with hundreds or thousands of databases, can use this stack across the entire enterprise both for 2D and 3D development.

The term metaverse is a combination of the Greek words meta, which means ""beyond,"" ""transcending,"" or ""more comprehensive,"" and english word universe, which means ""all existing matter and space."" The options for entering virtual reality are limited to open and closed metaverses. Because there is no single, universal vision of a 3D virtual world on which everyone can agree, we believe the Metaverse will be made up of a number of open and closed ecosystems.

You can think of the stack which we will cover in this course in terms of layers. The first layer is the Web 2.0 technologies which provide the tools to develop 2D frontends and a highly sclable and cost effective cloud backend. The second layer is the Web 3.0 technolgies that is built using the first layer and the Ethererum blockchain. The third layer replaces the 2D frontends with 3D and XR technolgies for developing metaverse experiences. In the third layer we use all the backend technologies included in the first two layers, only the frontend changes. The third metaverse layer can be based on open and closed ecosystems.

The Web 2.0 full stack applicatios are build using these technologies, this is the first layer of our development stack:

1. [Typescript Programming Language for Front-end and Backend Development](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Visual Studio Code Editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Front-end Web 2.0 Development Using Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
4. [Infrastructure as Code using AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
5. [AWS Lambda for Serverless Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
6. [Panacloud CLI for API Development](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@panacloud/cli)
7. [Amazon Aurora Serverless v2 PostgreSQL 13-compatible edition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html)

For more details check out the [Panacloud Web 2 Learning Repo](https://github.com/panacloud-modern-global-apps/nextjs) and [projects repo](https://github.com/panacloud-modern-global-apps/chakra-nextjs-projects)


This Web 2.0 stack can be easily extended to develop Web 3.0 Dapps using these technologies, this is the second layer:

1. [Ethereum Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/)
2. [Solidity Smart Contract Programming Language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
3. [OpenZepllin Smart Contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts)
4. [Hardhat Ethereum Development Envirnoment](https://hardhat.org/)
5. [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
6. [Metamask Wallet](https://metamask.io/)
7. [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
8. [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/)
9. [Chainlink](https://chain.link/)
10. Panacloud Panaweb Web 3 Framework (Under development)

For more details check out the [Panacloud Web 3 Learning Repo](https://github.com/panacloud-modern-global-apps/dapps-nextjs) and [Smart Contract Learning Repo](https://github.com/panacloud-modern-global-apps/defi-dapps-solidity-smart-contracts)

The Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 layers can easily be extended to develop Metaverse experiences, which is the third layer in our stack. The backend will remain more less the same, the front-end will move towards 3D XR experiences from 2D user interfaces.

The metaverse development stack can be may be an open ecosystem with browser acting as a sort of operating system:

### Blockchain Project 1: Create a Token and Launch ICO/IEO/IDO


As you probably know, the ICO (""Initial Coin Offering"") industry has been booming, and it's completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart themselves. In fact, go have a look at [Wikipedia's list of highest crowdfunding projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects), and you'll notice that blockchain projects absolutely dominate the list.

Note: Also document the alternatives to Binance Launchpad.


Project Part 2: How to Launch a IDO on Polkastarter

Review the [list of top fundraising platforms](https://cryptorank.io/fundraising-platforms)

Your second task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IDO on the [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/).


Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token

By creating an token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralised service in the future.

Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).

Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use openzeppelin contracts. You will use Harkhat development envirnoment. Also, write at least 20 automated tests. We will be using the Solidity and Typescript for dvelopment.

Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract

This contract will be responsible to allow users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to
Set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)

Implement a payable buyToken() function. 

Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought

Transfer 75% the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal ""owner"" account.

Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.

You can use the [openzeppelin crowd sale contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales), however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.

Also write exentisive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract's balance should have been reduced.

Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review [access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control).

Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask

While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!

We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.

When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts was uploaded to and copy it!

Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.

After the transaction has confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to ""register"" it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!

To do this, open the side menu and click on the ""Add token"" button to get started:

Once you're on the token page, click on ""Add custom token"" and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.

After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

Project Part 6: Trying it with Multisignature Wallets

[Read](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/)

Now use [Gnosis Safe]{https://gnosis-safe.io/) with multi-sigs to do what you did in the last part.


Project Part 7: Sending Tokens using Ethers.js 

Write a Typescript program to send Pako Token to some friend's address using Ethers.js.

[You may follow this tutorial](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/send-token-etherjs/)


Project Part 8 Advance: Create, Deploy, Mint, and Sell a NFT

[Read this NFT tutorial series](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)

Create a NFT contract using the [OpenZepplen ERC721 NFT Standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).

You may use the [Preset ERC721 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#Presets).

Deploy your NFT contract on a testnet, mint it, and view it on the MetaMask wallet and list it on [OpenSea Marketplace](https://opensea.io/) for sale.

## Appendix

## Appendix A: Key Concepts

## Web 3.0

[Web 3.0](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b) is a concept for the internet's next generation. It is the evolution of user control and ownership over their creations and online content, digital assets, and online identities. Users in Web 3.0 can create content while owning, controlling, and monetizing it through the use of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

## Metaverse

While precise definitions are difficult to come by, the metaverse is generally thought to be a network of 3-D virtual worlds where people can interact, conduct business, and form social connections using their virtual ""avatars."" Consider it a virtual reality version of today's internet.

The definition of the metaverse extends beyond virtual worlds such as gaming and virtual reality applications. The broader vision of the metaverse includes smart manufacturing technology, virtual advertising, online events such as concerts, and digital currencies such as Ethereum.

## Serverless Cloud Computing

Web2 centralized serverless cloud technologies will also play a major role on the internet in the short to medium term until Web3 technologies mature and totally replace web2 technologies. 


### Web3 Metaverse: Decentraland and Sandbox on Ethereum

The most popular Metaverse projects at the moment are Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND), which provide virtual worlds where users can interact, buy land via an Ethereum smart contract, and live in an alternate reality. Both operate entirely on the Ethereum blockchain and allow users to buy real estate and build properties with cryptocurrencies, with SAND offering user-generated content that gives it limitless creative power. Panaverse will cover these projects in depth. 

To provide Web 3 functionality we will use the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) blockchain and [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) programming language for smart contract development. 


### The AR Glasses: Apple AR Glasses

As discussed in detail in this [article](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3654197/enterprise-ar-will-be-dominated-by-apple-and-magic-leap.html) we also believe that Apple will lead the AR and Metaverse space on the glasses side. There [M1 processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1) are the most efficient processors in the world. Some derivative of the M1 will power the Apple AR glasses. Apple's [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/arkit/) is also quite mature. Apple's [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) programming language is extremely powerfull. The combination of the hardware and the software stacks will be extremely difficult to beat in the next few years. The main competetors Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google are three to five years behind right now. As developers the only down side is going to be the total lock-in.  

### Cloud Computing: AWS Serverless Computing

On the backend in the medium term Web3 technologies will be complemented by Web2 [AWS Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) Cloud combined with [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) will provide an extremely scalable platform, with Typescript as the programming language of choice.

### Part 2: Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD)

Universal Scene Description (USD) is an open source framework developed by Pixar for exchanging 3D computer graphics data across different applications. It is designed to be flexible and extensible to other collaborative environments that run interconnected tools, such as NVIDIA Omniverse. More than a dozen companies from Apple, Nvidia, Adobe, to Unity support USD. The standard is on the cusp of becoming the solder that fuses all sorts of virtual and physical worlds into a metaverse.

Also, people could play games via interaction with this bot to earn money (sometimes to lose money).

There are a lot of features and ideas that are still in development. Let me know if you have any cool ideas.

### Invite ""Hummie"" to your Discord server

[Click To Invite](http://invite.hummie.funnynation.org)

```Hummie``` is an official Funny Nation bot that is free for everyone to use. 

However, if you want to build your own funny nation bot, please read the instruction below. 


### Before Deploy your bot

You need to set up a Discord application and get a Discord bot token. If you don't know how to do that, please read the tutorial [at this link](docs/discord-bot-setup-tutorial/README.md). 


### Deploy with Docker

Requirements: 
* Docker
* A PostgresSQL database with URL - Example: ```postgresql://username:password@database.url:5432/databasename```
* A Discord Bot Token

#### From Docker hub

```shell
docker run --name funnynation \
 -e DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://your-postgres-database-url"" \
 -e DISCORD_TOKEN=""your-discord-token"" \
 -d plbin97/funny-nation
```

#### Or build your own Docker Image

```shell
docker build -t funnynation .
```

```shell
docker run --name funnynation \
 -e DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://your-postgres-database-url"" \
 -e DISCORD_TOKEN=""your-discord-token"" \
 -d funnynation
```

### Deploy with Nodejs

Requirements:
* An Node environment, ```16.x``` recommended
* A PostgresSQL database with URL - Example: ```postgresql://username:password@database.url:5432/databasename```
* A Discord Bot Token

#### Step1: Install dependency
```shell
# For development
npm install

# For production
npm install --omit=dev
```

#### Step2: Build
```shell
npm run build
```

#### Step3: Database Migration

```shell
# For development
DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://your-postgres-database-url"" \
npm devmigrate

# For production
DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://your-postgres-database-url"" \
npm migrate
```

#### Step4: Run
```shell
DATABASE_URL=""postgresql://your-postgres-database-url"" \
DISCORD_TOKEN=""your-discord-token"" \
npm start
```

### Superuser (God)

You can add one more environment variable ```SUPERUSERID``` to claim a super user. 

The value of ```SUPERUSERID``` is the user id. 

```SUPERUSERID``` is optional. 
```
SUPERUSERID=123123123
```

mvs-org/metaverse-vm,Rust,"# Hyperspace Mainnet
Hyperspace Mainnet Node - Stage 1 - PoS Consensus Mode - (Hybrid PoW/Pos and Stratum protocol implementation will be available  on Stage 2)

First of all you have to get the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/hyperspace
```

# Setting up enviroment
Install Substrate pre-requisites (including Rust):
For Unix-based operating systems, you should run the following commands:
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

rustup default nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
You will also need to install the following packages:

Linux:
```
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git clang libclang-dev
```
Linux on ARM: rust-lld is required for linking wasm, but is missing on non Tier 1 platforms. So, use this script to build lld and create the symlink /usr/bin/rust-lld to the build binary.

Mac:
```
brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm
```

# Build the corresponding binary file:
```
cd Hyperspace
cargo build --release
```
The first build takes a long time, as it compiles all the necessary libraries.

# To start the full node you just compiled
```
./target/release/hyperspace --chain=hyperspace.json --name MyNode1
```

mvs-org/mips,,"# MIPs 
Metaverse Improvement Proposals (MIPs) describe standards for the Metaverse platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

# Contributing
First review [MMIP-1](meta-mip/MMIP-1.md). Then clone the repository and add your MIP to it. There is a [template MIP here](mip-X.md). Then submit a Pull Request to Metaverse's [MIPs repository](https://github.com/mvs-org/mips).

# MIP status terms
* **Draft** - an MIP that is open for consideration
* **Accepted** - an MIP that is planned for immediate adoption, i.e. expected to be included in the next hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer MIPs).
* **Final** - an MIP that has been adopted in a previous hard fork (for Core/Consensus layer MIPs).
* **Deferred** - an MIP that is not being considered for immediate adoption. May be reconsidered in the future for a subsequent hard fork.

Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of identifying, collating and synthesising primary scientific research (such as articles and reports) for the purposes of providing reliable, transparent summaries.

The goal of this project is to collect, integrate and expand the universe of available functions for ES projects in R, via our proposed metaverse package. Like tidyverse, metaverse is envisioned as a collector package that makes it straightforward to install a set of functions – currently located in separate packages – for a common purpose.

## Installation

You can install the the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages(""devtools"")
# install.packages(""remotes"")
devtools::install_github(""rmetaverse/metaverse"", dependencies = TRUE)
```

On Linux, you may need to 

```bash
sudo apt install libudunits2-dev

A batteries-included ethereum blockchain for bootstrapping the Metaverse. 🚀🚀🚀

Includes contracts for identity, inventory, currency and trade. Can be extended for any kind of marketplace application, but the goal is fast, free interoperable transfer of all user data from one server-authoratative platform to another. The ideal use case we imagine is a portal between two separate virtual worlds, sharing user data over the blockchain.

## Docs
http://blockchain.xrengine.io/v1/api-docs/

## What Is This?
A Node.js-based REST API, Ethereum node, cache service and smart contracts to deploy your own Ethereum-based sidechain for identity and durable assets. Users can transfer assets created on your platform to the Ethereum or Polygon main networks.

## Who Is It For?
1. Javascript developers who want to build interoperable applications with durable digital assets but don't have the resources to write everything from scratch and need a starting point which they can mold to their needs.

2. Developers interested in creating metaverse-scale interoperable applications where users may want to move their assets and identity to other platforms.

3. Developers of existing applications who cannot reasonably remove their database from their application and want to mirror this data onto blockchain or vice versa.

4. Organizations who wish to build blockchains with other organizations and need a standard and conventional way to do so.

Full GUI managment of a Custodial SideChain

What are sidechains? They are either:

1. Custodial - assets are moved to a parallel chain with its own consensus mechanism & security.

2. Non-custodial - assets are held & state is secured by smart contracts on Ethereum (= can survive an attack of the sidechain).

billmei/every-proximity-chat-app,,"# Every Proximity Chat, Metaverse, and Video Conference Socializing App

I regularly host online events like [Learning Night](https://billmei.net/blog/learning-night), [Creating Crew](https://billmei.net/blog/creating-crew), and [Idea Club](https://billmei.net/blog/idea-club), and I haven't yet settled on what proximity video chat app to use. So I decided to try them all.

There are more than 50 of these now and I created this repo because I wanted to keep track of them all in one place.

If you want to add your app, feel free to open a pull request to add your app to the list. You can list your app under the appropriate category in alphabetical order. If you want your app removed from this list, you can also open a pull request to do that too.

I tried every app here and wrote a short description of it based on my experience. If you are the owner of the app and want a different description, feel free to open a pull request to change it (the description must fit into one line).

jasmineroberts/metaverse-stack,CSS,"# Understanding the XR Technology Stack

There are a myriad of options for developing immersive experience and the details complex. It seems as if biweekly, there are new SDKs, frameworks and technologies introduced to XR (Augmented, Virtual and Mixed Reality) developers. 

Anyone new to the field or with a keen interest in learning may have the potential to be a great contributor but have no insights regarding the pipeline or how to approach building for XR. This repository seeks to consolidate information for current and aspiring XR developers.

*Note: This is a resource from a lecture given November 17, 2021 for CS 460 Computer Graphics. This does not include cryptocurrencies/blockchain technologies. This is specifically geared towards XR, 3D, and gaming technologies*

![coverage report](https://git.tivolicloud.com/tivolicloud-private/metaverse/badges/master/coverage.svg)

### Develop

Please use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) `npm i -g yarn` for dependencies. Npm is really terrible for CI/CD.

To start developing, you need to run two commands simulatenously.

```bash
cd server
yarn install # only once
yarn run start
```

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install # only once
yarn run start
```

They will both incrementally watch for file changes. The metaverse should now be available at http://localhost:3000

### Deploy

```bash
docker build -t tivolicloud/metaverse:base -f Dockerfile.base .
```

```bash
./build.sh
docker build -t tivolicloud/metaverse:latest -f Dockerfile .
```

Fill out `docker-compose.yml`

Environment variables can be found in [server/src/environment.ts](server/src/environment.ts)

<!-- ### Deploy

Make sure to **disable Nginx** when deploying to **Elastic Beanstalk**.

1 - Integrate metaverse wallet into your dapp with your DID  
2 - Issue and transfer MST’s  
3 - Issue and transfer MIT’s  
4 - learn the metaverse command line  
5 - create metaverse wallet plugin  
6 - execute coin swaps  
7 - create multisig transactions  
8 - understanding Metaverse MIPs  

For more information refer to the [Metaverse Documentation](https://docs.mvs.org/docs/)

Please follow the Environment setup instructions below before starting.

# Environment Setup

Start by entering the ""playground"" directory. This is where you can build ALL your Metaverse apps during the tutorial.

```bash
cd tutorials/playground
```

**Interact with metaverse libraries via nodejs**

create a testScript
```
touch testScript.js
```

To interact with Metaverse using javascript you can interact with mvs-blockchain-js and metaversejs

For use in nodejs scripts, import mvs-blockchain from the mvs-blockchain folder, and require metaversjs.

Inside the testscript, add:

```javascript
//import mvs-blockchain-js
let blockchain = require('../../mvs-blockchain-js')({
    url: ""https://explorer-testnet.mvs.org/api/""
});


//import metaversjs
let Metaverse = require('metaversejs');

//make sure the libraries have been successfully imported

console.log(blockchain)
console.log(""mvs-blockchain-js has been successfully imported!"")
console.log(Metaverse)
console.log(""Metaversjs has been successfully imported!"")
```

now run

```bash
node testScript.js
```

**Interact with metaverse via webapp**

First create an html file
```bash
touch index.html
```

and add

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset=""utf-8"">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

```

To interact with webapps you must generate ""index.js"" from mvs-blockchain-js and ""metaverse.min.js"" from metaversejs. To generate these files you must clone each repository separately, namely [metaversjs](https://github.com/canguruhh/metaversejs) and [mvs-blockchain-js](https://github.com/mvs-org/mvs-blockchain-js) and simply run

```bash
grunt
```

This will generate javascript files into the /dist folder that you can import into your app.  You don't have to worry about this for now. We have generated these files and placed them in the playground folder. To include them in your webapp just add these script tags into your html page.

```html
<script src = ""metaverse.min.js""></script>
<script src = ""index.min.js""></script>
```

Serve your webpage
```python
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4444
```

To test that the libraries have been successfully imported into your webpage, open the web console and enter

```javascript
blockchain = await Blockchain({url: ""https://explorer-testnet.mvs.org/api/""})

blockchain

Metaverse
```

You should see the ""blockchain"" (from mvs-blockchain-js) and Metaverse (from metaversjs) objects show up in the console.

You should now be fully set up and ready to begin tutorial 1.

```

### 2. Create your stream function

```bash
$ yomo init yomo-app-demo

⌛  Initializing the Stream Function...
✅  Congratulations! You have initialized the stream function successfully.
ℹ️   You can enjoy the YoMo Stream Function via the command: 
ℹ️   	DEV: 	yomo dev -n Noise yomo-app-demo/app.go
ℹ️   	PROD: 	First run source application, eg: go run example/source/main.go
		Second: yomo run -n yomo-app-demo yomo-app-demo/app.go

$ cd yomo-app-demo

```

CLI will automatically create the `app.go`:

```go
package main

import (
	""context""
	""encoding/json""
	""fmt""
	""time""

	""github.com/yomorun/yomo/rx""
)

// NoiseData represents the structure of data
type NoiseData struct {
	Noise float32 `json:""noise""` // Noise value
	Time  int64   `json:""time""`  // Timestamp (ms)
	From  string  `json:""from""`  // Source IP
}

var echo = func(_ context.Context, i interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
	value := i.(*NoiseData)
	value.Noise = value.Noise / 10
	rightNow := time.Now().UnixNano() / int64(time.Millisecond)
	fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf(""[%s] %d > value: %f ⚡️=%dms"", value.From, value.Time, value.Noise, rightNow-value.Time))
	return value.Noise, nil
}

// Handler will handle data in Rx way
func Handler(rxstream rx.Stream) rx.Stream {
	stream := rxstream.
		Unmarshal(json.Unmarshal, func() interface{} { return &NoiseData{} }).
		Debounce(50).
		Map(echo).
		StdOut()

	return stream
}

func DataTags() []byte {

vircadia/metaverse-dashboard,Vue,"# Metaverse Dashboard (Codename Iamus)

**Notice: Marked for deprecation, will be replaced with https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-web/ which will include both this dashboard's features and a full featured web client for visiting virtual worlds in Vircadia. As a result, this repository is currently being maintained but no new features are being added.**

## Deployment

A consideration for deployment is that this is an SPA (single page application) and therefore will require a simple server-side [configuration](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode.html) change in the case of a page refresh.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Docker
This creates a docker image called `metaverse-dashboard` that can be used with docker-compose at `vircadia-domain-server-docker`. This image also can be used for development purposes.

### docker Build
In order to build, go to the `docker` dir and execute the build script.
```bash
cd docker && docker-build.sh
```

### docker run
In order to run a container based on the image, go to the `docker` dir and execute the run script.
```bash
cd docker && run-metaverse-dashboard.sh
```
Port 8080 will be open and its log can be found in the `log` dir.

# nft-generator-py

![preview](https://github.com/Jon-Becker/nft-generator-py/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)

nft-generator-py is a python based NFT generator which programatically generates unique images using weighted layer files. The program is simple to use, and new layers can  be added by adding a new layer object and adding names, weights, and image files to the object.
You can [View The Demo](https://jbecker.dev/demos/nft-generator-py) here.

## Usage
As of v2.0.0, nft-generator-py will use the argparse library in order to support external configuration files and won't require users to interact with the python files themselves.

1. Install requirements: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Make a configuration JSON file. See the configuration section below for specifications.
3. Add layer files into the `/images` folder.
4. Run the command `python3 generate.py --amount AMOUNT --config CONFIG`
   
   where:
   1. `AMOUNT` is the amount of images to generate
   2. `CONFIG` is the path pointing to a `.json` file containing valid program configuration.

## How it works
- A call to `generate_unique_images(amount, config)` is made, which is the meat of the application where all the processing happens.
- The `config` object is read and for each object in the `layers` list, random values are selected and checked for uniqueness against all previously generated metadata files.
- Once we have `amount` unique tokens created, we layer them against eachother and output them and their metadata to their respective folders, `./metadata` and `./images`.

### Configuration
```
{
  ""layers"": [
    {
      ""name"": ""Background"",
      ""values"": [""Blue"", ""Orange"", ""Purple"", ""Red"", ""Yellow""],
      ""trait_path"": ""./trait-layers/backgrounds"",
      ""filename"": [""blue"", ""orange"", ""purple"", ""red"", ""yellow""],
      ""weights"": [30, 45, 15, 5, 10]
    },
    ...
  ],
  ""incompatibilities"": [
    {
      ""layer"": ""Background"",
      ""value"": ""Blue"",
      ""incompatible_with"": [""Python Logo 2""],
      ""default"": {
        ""value"": ""Default Incompatibility"",
        ""filename"": ""./trait-layers/foreground/logo""
      }
    }
  ],
  ""baseURI"": ""."",
  ""name"": ""NFT #"",
  ""description"": ""This is a description for this NFT series.""
}
```

The `config` object is a dict that contains configuration instructions that can be changed to produce different outputs when running the program. Within metadata files, tokens are named using the configuration's `name` parameter, and described using the `description` parameter. 
- In ascending order, tokenIds are appended to the `name` resulting in NFT metadata names such as NFT #0001. 
- tokenIds are padded to the largest amount generated. IE, generating 999 objects will result in names NFT #001, using the above configuration, and generating 1000 objects will result in NFT #0001.
- As of `v1.0.2`, padding filenames has been removed.

The `layers` list contains `layer` objects that define the layers for the program to use when generating unique tokens. Each `layer` has a name,  which will be displayed as an attribute, values, trait_path, filename, and weights.
- `trait_path` refers to the path where the image files in `filename` can be found. Please note that filenames omit .png, and it will automatically be prepended.
- `weight` corresponds with the percent chance that the specific value that weight corresponds to will be selected when the program is run. The weights must add up to 100, or the program will fail.

The `incompatibilities` list contains an object that tells the program what layers are incompatible with what. In the above configuration, A Blue Background `layer` will *never* be generated with Python Logo 2.
- `layer` refers to the targeted layer.
- `value` is the value of the layer that is incompatible with attributes within the `incompatible_with` list.
- `incompatible_with` is the list of incompatible layers that will never be selected when `layer` has attribute `value`.
- An optional `default` object can be provided to each incompatibility. This object will be selected 100% of the time if present and an incompatible layer is selected. The `default` object has a `value` and `filename` attribute.
  - `value` is the name of the default selection which will be displayed in the metadata.
  - `filename` is the path to the image file that will be used as the default selection.

As of `v1.0.2`, the IPFS CID may be updated programatically after generating NFTs and uploading `/images` to IPFS. This will update all metadata files to correctly point `""image""` to the IPFS CID.
- *This is an optional step, and can be exited safely using `enter` or `control + c`.*

#### Troubleshooting
- All images should be in .png format.
- All images should be the same size in pixels, IE: 1000x1000.
- The weight values for each attribute should add up to equal 100.

# Meta Animation Packager

This tool will help you bundle your 3D assets for use in [Metaverse Studio](https://gometa.io). Right now, due to restrictions with iOS, you will need to use a Mac to bundle your assets.

## Prerequisites

- A computer running macOS
- A Wavefront (OBJ) export of your 3D asset, including materials and textures
- A PNG or animated GIF preview of your 3D asset, with transparency
- If your asset has animations, a separate Collada (DAE) export for each animation

## Setting up the directories

Look at the `example/astronaut` folder in this repository for an example of how you must setup the directory. You *MUST* have a folder named `obj`, containing in its root the OBJ export. If your asset has animations, you must export each named animation to its own folder under a folder named `dae`. The name of the folder will be the display name of the animation in Metaverse studio. Each animation must include its own copy of the image textures.

## Packaging

Run the `package.sh` script with the folder root as the argument:

```bash
$ ./package.sh example/astronaut
```

When the script finishes, you will have a ZIP archive named `folder.meta.zip` that can be uploaded to Metaverse Studio.

## Notes

**Notes when exporting Collada files**
- Make sure image textures are referenced relative to the `.dae` file. **If your texture uses absolute paths, it will not render correctly.** You can verify this by opening the `.dae` file in a text editor and looking fort the `<library_images>` tag. If all you see in the `<init_from>` tags is the texture name, you're good. If you see things like `file:///Users/user/Desktop/` or anything like that, you will need to edit the file to remove the path.
- Make sure your units are set to **meters**
- Make sure your object scale is normalized to `(1, 1, 1)`

**Notes about file sizes**
- Metaverse loads assets over the network. Please be concious of this when designing and exporting your assets. For seamless loading, you should keep each export under 5MB in size."

Open-Source 3D Internet Metaverse - Multiverse - 3D CMS (Content Management System) to Build Games and 3D Shopping Websites
Invented and created by Aaron Dishno Ed.D. CEO and Founder of HTTP3D Inc. - WalkTheWeb

I believe the Internet should always be Free and Available to all. Do you really want the big gaming companies to own the Metaverse and kill the full potential with censorship and advertising? Help me build a Free 3D Internet Metaverse by using and supporting Open-Source WalkTheWeb. I am calling for PROGRAMMERS, DESIGNERS, and ARTISTS to unite! So that Everyone owns the Metaverse.

To start, create your own Metaverse - Multiverse with our easy to use WalkTheWeb 3D Internet Hosting software. While you do not have to be a programer to use it, programmers can easily take advantage of the Babylonjs.com Game Engine and build 3D Games and 3D Content using our 3D CMS software and your own code together. 3D Artists (3D Model Designers) can show off their work quickly in a working environment with Avatars and 3D Scenes.  Multiplayer functionality and services are readily available from WalkTheWeb (keeps the work load off your server). Babylonjs.com supports browser based devices that can use WebGL and 3D Scenes can be viewed by numerous camera views for Computers, Cell Phones, Tablets, and Virtual Reality equipment (VR). WalkTheWeb uses PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL it can be hosted on any server capable of running WordPress.

3D CMS is a 3D Content Management System for easily creating and hosting you own 3D Games, 3D Shopping and 3D Metaverse and Multiverse Scenes. Using the Babylonjs.com game engine and works completely in the browser (does not download an app). You can put each of your 3D Buildings or 3D Games into many 3D Community Scenes. Makes it easy to update in one place, yet a powerful distribution by allowing your 3D Building (or 3D Game) to be visited in many 3D Scenes! Think of it as combining WordPress with a 3D Game Engine at an exponential level!

Optional enhancement: Connect your 3D Store (WordPress and WooCommerce) using the WalkTheWeb WordPress Plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/walktheweb/
New Version coming soon that supports WalkTheWeb Open-Source Self Hosting! (https://github.com/HTTP3D/WalkTheWeb-WordPress-Plugin)

INSTALLATION

mvs-org/mvs-live,HTML,# the-metaverse.github.io
mvs-org/new-frontiers,Rust,"# MetaverseVM Node

Enter the [Metaverse](https://mvs.org). THE NEW REALITY :rocket:

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to take control and compile your own node. :hammer_and_wrench:

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./docs/rust-setup.md).

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/metaverse-vm -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/metaverse-vm --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/metaverse-vm purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/metaverse-vm -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Run the testnet

```
./target/release/metaverse-vm --chain testnet
```

### Conect your wallet

By default the node will provide a HTTP RPC endpoint on `http://127.0.0.1:9933` as well as a websocket RPC endpoint on `ws://127.0.0.1:9944`.

To connect your browser wallet or any other compatible wallet you can set the URL to the HTTP URL.

## Template Structure

Metaverse is built using the Substrate Blockchain Framework. A Substrate project such as this consists of a number of components that are spread across a few
directories.

### Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network. Nodes expose a number of capabilities:

-   Networking: Substrate nodes use the [`libp2p`](https://libp2p.io/) networking stack to allow the
    nodes in the network to communicate with one another.
-   Consensus: Blockchains must have a way to come to
    [consensus](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus) on the state of the
    network. Substrate makes it possible to supply custom consensus engines and also ships with
    several consensus mechanisms that have been built on top of
    [Web3 Foundation research](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html).
-   RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with Substrate nodes.

There are several files in the `node` directory - take special note of the following:

-   [`chain_spec.rs`](./node/src/chain_spec.rs): A
    [chain specification](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/chain-spec) is a
    source code file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain specifications
    are useful for development and testing, and critical when architecting the launch of a
    production chain. Take note of the `development_config` and `testnet_genesis` functions, which
    are used to define the genesis state for the local development chain configuration. These
    functions identify some
    [well-known accounts](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#well-known-keys)
    and use them to configure the blockchain's initial state.
-   [`service.rs`](./node/src/service.rs): This file defines the node implementation. Take note of
    the libraries that this file imports and the names of the functions it invokes. In particular,
    there are references to consensus-related topics, such as the
    [longest chain rule](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus#longest-chain-rule),
    the [Aura](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus#aura) block authoring
    mechanism and the
    [GRANDPA](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus#grandpa) finality
    gadget.

After the node has been [built](#build), refer to the embedded documentation to learn more about the
capabilities and configuration parameters that it exposes:

```shell
./target/release/metaverse-vm --help
```


### Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then run the following command to start a single node development chain.

```bash
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

This command will firstly compile your code, and then start a local development network. You can
also replace the default command (`cargo build --release && ./target/release/metaverse-vm --dev --ws-external`)
by appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.

```bash
# Run Substrate node without re-compiling
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/metaverse-vm --dev --ws-external

# Purge the local dev chain
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/metaverse-vm purge-chain --dev

# Check whether the code is compilable
./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check
```

make-live/multiplayer,C++,"# Unreal Engine 5 - Multiplayer / Open World Template

An evolving template to allow teams the ability to test out multiplayer Pixel Streaming applications and worlds.

The template implements a multiplayer example deployable that can be deployed to Make Live. As Unreal Engine instances are deployed within the same private network (when uploaded using Make Live) game sessions can be seen by each other.

Useful for testing applications and worlds.  Dedicated server(s) would need to be rolled out in order to support mass amounts of players and persistent sessions. Watch this space for how we want to make this easy for people using the Make Live platform.

Template Features Include:

- C++ Unreal Engine project exposing functionallity to Blueprints as much as possible
- [Unreal Engine Pixel Streaming Plugin Enabled](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/pixel-streaming-in-unreal-engine/)

  <br>
  A javascript library for the Metaverse blockchain
</p>

## Installation
Install using npm:
``` bash
npm install metaversejs
```

## Setup
### NodeJS
``` javascript
let Metaverse = require('metaversejs');
```
<a href=""https://nodei.co/npm/metaversejs/""><img src=""https://nodei.co/npm/metaversejs.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true""></a>
### Browser
For use in webapps the npm package contains a dist/metaverse.min.js. You can generate this file from source using grunt.

## Usage

Please also check the examples folder.

### Wallet generation
``` javascript
let Metaverse = require('metaversejs')

let number_of_addresses = 10

Metaverse.wallet.generateMnemonic()
    .then((mnemonic) => Metaverse.wallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic)
        .then((wallet) => {
            let addresses = []
            for (let i = 0; i < number_of_addresses; i++) {
                addresses.push(wallet.getAddress(i))
            }
            return {
                ""mnemonic"": mnemonic,
                ""addresses"": addresses,
                ""wallet"": wallet
            }
        }))
    .then(console.log)
```
This will generate a new random wallet and return the mnemonic words as well as the first 10 addresses of the wallet.

### Send ETP or MST
As Metaverse is UTXO based you need to specify the inputs and outputs of the transaction. The following example creates a basic P2PKH (pay to public key hash) transaction.
``` javascript
//Transaction object
var tx = new Metaverse.transaction()
//Add inputs
tx.addInput(""MKXYH2MhpvA3GU7kMk8y3SoywGnyHEj5SB"",""5554b27dbf657d008511df56e747ffb2173749fd933b03317cee3c1fde271aea"",1)
//Add outputs
tx.addOutput(""MVpxH8aAa3BAXvbdqUUJwEP6s2ajGKKtyd"",""ETP"",1)
tx.addOutput(""MKXYH2MhpvA3GU7kMk8y3SoywGnyHEj5SB"",""ETP"",4939995)
console.log('transaction details: ' + tx)
//Sign the inputs
wallet.sign(tx)
    .then( (stx) => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx)
    })
```
You can also add other assets to the transaction. The resulting raw transaction can be broadcasted to any blockchain nodes.

Another way for creating transactions is to use the transaction builder.

``` javascript
const target = {
   ""ETP"": 100000000,
   ""MST"": {
      ""MVS.HUG"": 5
   }
}
Metaverse.transaction_builder.send(utxo, recipient_address, recipient_avatar, target, change_address, change, locked_asset_change, fee, messages)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

For standard transaction the transaction builder is the preferred way so the next examples will use the transaction builder only.

### Deposit
In order to create a deposit and get interest you just have to add a lock output to a transaction. Possible values for the duration are: 25200, 108000, 331200, 655200 and 1314000 blocks on the mainnet.
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction_builder.deposit(utxo, recipient_address, quantity, duration, change_address, change, fee, network, messages)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```
The reward transaction will be generated by the miner of the block that will contain the transaction.

### Issue asset
In order to issue a new asset add an asset issue output to a transaction. Please make sure that the asset symbol is unique. Precision must be in range 0..19 and the maximum supply is must be provided as a quantity of the smallest unit. An asset with 1000 tokens that should have a precision of 2 decimals must be provided as 1000000 and precision 2. The transaction fee must be 10 ETP.
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction_builder.issueAsset(inputs, recipient_address, symbol, max_supply, precision, issuer, description, secondaryissue_threshold, is_secondaryissue, change_address, change, issue_domain, bounty_fee, network)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

### Send to multiple recipients
``` javascript
const recipients = [ { address: ""xxx"", ""target"": { ""ETP"": 123, ""MST"": { ""SDG"": 18 } }, ""avatar"": ""EricGu"" } ]
Metaverse.transaction_builder.sendMore(utxo, recipients, change_address, change, locked_asset_change, fee, messages)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

### Lock MST
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction_builder.sendLockedAsset(utxo, recipient_address, symbol, quantity, attenuation_model, change_address, change, locked_asset_change, fee, messages)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

### Issue Avatar
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction_builder.issueDid(utxo, avatar_address, symbol, change_address, change, bounty_fee, network)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

### Issue MIT
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction_builder.registerMIT(utxo, recipient_address, issuer_avatar, symbol, content, change_address, change, fee)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

### Transfer MIT
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction_builder.transferMIT(utxo, sender_avatar, recipient_address, recipient_avatar, symbol, change_address, change, fee)
    .then( tx => wallet.sign(tx))
    .then( stx => {
        console.log('signed transaction: ' + stx)
        //Encode (serialize) the transaction
        return stx.encode()
    })
    .then( (raw_tx) => {
        console.log('Encoded transaction: ' + raw_tx.toString('hex'))
    })
```

### Attach message
To attach a message to any transaction there is a function called addMessage. If you use the transaction builder you can use the messages parameter to add an array of messages that will be added to the transaction. For manual addition of messages you can do the following:
``` javascript
//Transaction object
var tx = new Metaverse.transaction();
//Add inputs
tx.addInput(""tK8UKnBKhk4NQYhSeSb2zeWgMSZaHsn1TY"", ""15a3a80a867315ee1d3f1ff67e7d5cd0709b1a1d4a48a938f33b01ec8f47425f"", 0);
//Add message
tx.addMessage(""tK8UKnBKhk4NQYhSeSb2zeWgMSZaHsn1TY"", ""hi. this is so easy!"");
//Don't forget the change
tx.addOutput(""tK8UKnBKhk4NQYhSeSb2zeWgMSZaHsn1TY"", ""ETP"", 299990000);
```

### Decode transaction
You can also easily decode a hex encoded transaction.
``` javascript
Metaverse.transaction.decode(rawtx)
```
Not all information about the previous outputs of the inputs are enoded in a raw transaction. If you want to encode the transaction again you have to add the missing values to the inputs.

## Testing
To run the unit tests just execute:
``` bash
npm test
```

# Vircadia Web SDK

The **Vircadia Web SDK** (codename Ananke) is a JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for developing web-based applications for virtual worlds powered by the open source metaverse platform [Vircadia](https://vircadia.com/). Vircadia domain servers provide the worlds (a.k.a. ""domains"") to visit, and the Vircadia
metaverse server provides global services that connect the users and domains.
See the user docs to [Understand the Architecture](https://docs.vircadia.com/explore/get-started/architecture.html).

This SDK provides interfaces to:
- Connect to domains.
- Use metaverse services.

The SDK is written in TypeScript.
- [Project Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md)
- [Coding Standard](CODING_STANDARD.md)

The SDK is published at NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vircadia/web-sdk

To learn more about using Vircadia's metaverse ecosystem, see the [Developer Documentation](https://docs.vircadia.dev).


## Prerequisites

### Node.js

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

**Node.js** version &ge; 10.13 ; LTS version &ge; 14.16 recommended  
**npm** version &ge; 6.4.1 ; LTS version &ge; 6.14 recommended

### Jest

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used for unit testing. It is included as an NPM dev dependency, however, you may also install it globally if you want
to. 

## Project Setup

### Get the source

```
git clone https://github.com/vircadia/vircadia-web-sdk.git
```

If you're working on Vircadia protocol code (that in the `\src\domain` directory) it is recommended that you clone the SDK as
a subdirectory of the main Vircadia repo's source so that both sets of code are accessed when you open the main Vircadia repo's
source in your IDE. For example, if your clone of the main Vircadia repo's source is in `C:\Workspaces\vircadia` then clone
the SDK repo's source into `C:\Workspaces\vircadia-web-sdk`. Thus with the main Vircadia's repo loaded in your IDE, when
you search for code then both C++ and TypeScript results are returned, helping you compare the two codebases and keep them in
sync.

Note: Unix line endings (LF, `0A` character) are used. If using Windows it is recommended that you configure Git's global setting `core.autocrlf` to be `true`. This makes the files use Windows line endings (CRLF, `0D0A` characters) on your computer but stores the files in the Git repo with Linux line endings.


### Install NPM packages

```
npm install
```
Loads all the supporting NPM packages as defined in `package.json` into the `node_modules` directory.

## Development and Testing

### Compile and minify for development
```
npm run build
```
Does a development compile and packages the SDK into the `dist` directory.

### Hot-recompile for development
```
npm run watch
```
Does a development compile and enables webpack to watch the sources and recomile when source files change.
This is often useful when testing SDK development using the `example` tool.

### Compile and minify for production
```
npm run build-prod
```
Does a clean production compile and packages a releasable version of the SDK into the `dist` directory.

### Hot-recompile for production
```
npm run watch-prod
```
Does a clean production compile and enables webpack to watch the sources and recompile when the source files change.

### Clean the build directory
```
npm run clean
```

### Lint files

All files:
```
npm run lint
```

A specific directory or file:
```
npm run lint-path <path>
```

### Run tests

Unit tests can be run without any external dependencies but integration tests require a domain server to be running on
`localhost` or other location specified in `./tests/test.config.json`. The location and other values of the config JSON can be
overridden with environment variables, using the same property names, but prefixed with ""VIRCADIA_"".

All tests:
```
npm run test
```
Hot retest of all tests:
```
npm run test-watch
```

Specific tests (e.g., Packet.unit.test.js, all unit tests, all integration tests):
```
npm run test <partial-path>

npm run test /packet.unit
npm run test .unit.
npm run test .integration.
```

Run tests and report open handles:
```
npm run test-debug [<partial-path>]
```


### Generate docs

SDK API documentation:
```
npm run sdkdoc
```

Developer documentation (includes SDK API documentation):
```
npm run devdoc
```

wonglok/effectnode-metaverse,JavaScript,"# EffectNode Metaverse - a Boilerplate for You

![SkyCity Church](https://github.com/wonglok/effectnode-metaverse/raw/master/docs/landing.png)

Effect Node METAVERSE is a open source boilerplate project for helping everyone own their own metaverse.

The Vision for Effect Node Metaverse is that everyone should be able to own a piece of the whole metaverse cake over the internet. LokLok, the sole inventor of EffectNode, wants to embrace the hyperlink in the internet because it’s the fundamental of the internet that is letting users flow to different information with a breeze.

3D Content on the web has always been a high price / high cost for anyone who wants to own a piece of the metaverse cake. And by sharing the starter boilerplate, it made the metaverse open and to prevent a single ownership of the technology.

We all don’t really like having to pay a royalty fee to every creation that we yearn to make.

# [Run Guide](https://github.com/egametang/ET/blob/master/Book/1.1RunGuide.md)  

# Major Notes.
1. Hotfix with HotfixView is pure logic, do not have any fields in the class, otherwise the hotfix will be lost  
2. ETTask and either call Coroutine or await, open the error list window in VS, do not use these two will be reported as a problem, although neither await nor Coroutine, if you can compile through, but will lose the exception, very dangerous  
3. do not use any virtual functions, use logical distribution instead  
4. Please do not use any inheritance, except for Entity inheritance, use components instead.  


# ET6 has huge changes compared with ET5, and it can be said that Phoenix has become Yifei. 6.0 has the following amazing features
1. client-side logic code full hot update (based on ILRuntime) on ios, no part that can not be changed  
2. client and server can be hot reload, development without restarting the client and server can modify the logic code, development is extremely convenient  
3. robot framework, ET6 client-side logic and performance separation, robot program directly share the use of client-side logic layer code to do pressure testing, only a very small amount of code to make the robot, easy to pressure test the server  
4. test case framework, using the client's logic layer code to write unit tests, each unit test is a complete game environment, without all kinds of nasty mock  
5. AI framework, more convenient than the behavior tree, write AI than writing UI is still simple  
6. the new server-side architecture, extremely beautiful  
7. intranet and extranet kcp network, strong performance, with soft routing module, can prevent all kinds of network attacks  

# ET development of commercial mmo project thousand ancient wind flow successfully online, 64 core 128G memory single service single physical machine 1.5W online (the actual online planning for ecological restrictions for a single service 6000 people online at the same time, 6000 people then cpu consumption is about 30%). In order to stack line number normal, online run is Debug version, if you use Release version to open optimization, performance can also double, to reach a single physical machine 3W online! On-line for 5 months is very stable. Thousand ancient wind flow using the ET framework developed from scratch, it took two years, this development speed can be said that no one can be its right. The successful launch of Thousand Ancient Winds proves that ET has the ability to develop any large game, development speed, development efficiency are breathtaking! The client server technology used in Thousand Ancient Winds and Currents: 1.  
1. dynamic copies and sub-lines, on-demand allocation, recycling after use  
2. split line merge line, split line less number of people will merge multiple lines. Combined line function basically other mmo games rarely see  
3. seamless client-server scene switching, that is, seamless world technology  
4. cross-services copies, cross-services battlefield  
5. front and back-end integration, the use of client-side code to develop server pressure testing robot, four 24-core machine easily simulate 1W people to do the task  
6. a variety of ai design, the use of ET's new development of ai framework, so that ai development is as simple as writing ui  
7. test case framework, most of the important system, the thousand ancient wind flow are written test cases, different from the test cases on the market, each thousand ancient wind flow test cases are a complete game environment, for the protocol level, do not need to engage in a variety of interfaces to mock. write up very fast.  
8. aoi implementation of the nine-gong grid, dynamic adjustment of the players seen to reduce the server load  
9. anti-attack, a thousand ancient wind flow developed a soft route function, even if the attack can only attack to the soft route, once attacked, the player client found a few seconds no response, you can dynamically switch to other soft routes, the user almost no perception. The whole process of client network connection does not open, no loss of data.  
10. there are many, many more, here will not be verbose  


# ET's introduction.
ET is an open source game client (based on unity3d) server-side dual-end framework , the server side is developed using C# .net core distributed game server , which is characterized by high development efficiency , strong performance , dual-end shared logic code , client-side server hot more mechanism is perfect , while supporting reliable udp tcp websocket protocol , support for server-side 3D recast pathfinding, etc.  

# ET features.
### 1. available VS single-step debugging distributed server, N to 1  
Generally speaking, distributed server-side has to start many processes, and once there are more processes, single-step debugging becomes very difficult, resulting in server-side development basically relying on playing logs to find problems. ET framework uses a component design similar to Watchtower, all server-side content is broken down into individual components, which are mounted according to the type of server they need when starting. This is somewhat similar to computers, which are modularly broken down into memory, CPU, motherboard and other parts, with different parts can be assembled into a different computer, for example, a home desktop needs memory, CPU, motherboard, graphics card, monitor, hard disk. While servers for companies do not need monitors and graphics cards, computers in Internet cafes may not need hard disks, etc. Because of this design, the ET framework can hang all the server components on one server process, then this server process has all the functions of a server, and one process can be used as a whole group of distributed servers. This is also similar to the computer, the desktop has all the computer components, then it can also be completely used as a company server, but also as an Internet cafe computer.  
### 2. Distributed server that can be split into functions at will, 1 to N  
Distributed server to develop a variety of types of server processes, such as login server, gate server, battle server, chat server friend server and so on a large number of various servers, the traditional development method needs to know in advance the current function to be placed on which server, when more and more functions ET framework in the normal development time simply do not need to care about the current development of the function will be placed on what server, only use a process for development, functional development into the form of components. Release time to use a multi-process configuration can be released into the form of multi-process, is not very convenient it? Split the server however you want. You only need to modify a very small amount of code to split it. Different servers hooked up to different components on the line!  
### 3. Cross-platform distributed server  
ET framework using C# to do the server , C# is now completely cross-platform , install .netcore on linux , you can , without modifying any code , you can run . performance, now .netcore performance is very strong, than lua, python, js what is much faster. It is much faster than lua, python, js or anything else. It is not a problem to do game server. ET framework also provides a key synchronization tool , open unity->tools->rsync synchronization , you can synchronize the code to linux  
```bash
. /Run.sh Config/StartConfig/192.168.12.188.txt 
```
That's all it takes to compile and start the server.  
### 4. Provide concurrent support  
C# inherently supports asynchronous to synchronous syntax async and await, much more powerful than lua, python's concurrency, new versions of python and javascript language even copied C#'s concurrency syntax. Distributed server-side remote calls between a large number of servers, without the support of asynchronous syntax, development will be very troublesome. So java does not have asynchronous syntax, do a single service is okay, not suitable for large distributed game server. For example.  

```c#
// send C2R_Ping and wait for response message R2C_Ping
R2C_Ping pong = await session.Call(new C2R_Ping()) as R2C_Ping;
Log.Debug(""Received R2C_Ping"");

// query mongodb for a Player with id 1 and wait for the return
Player player = await Game.Scene.GetComponent<DBProxyComponent>().Query<Player>(1);
Log.Debug($""Printing player name: {player.Name}"")
```
As you can see, with async await, all the asynchronous operations between servers become very coherent and don't have to be split into multiple pieces of logic. Greatly simplifies distributed server development  
### 5. provide erlang-like actor message mechanism  
erlang language is a major advantage is the location of transparent messaging mechanism , the user does not care about the object in which the process , get the id can send messages to the object . ET framework also provides an actor message mechanism , the entity object only needs to hang on the MailBoxComponent component , the entity object becomes an Actor , any server only needs to know the Any server only needs to know the id of the entity object can send messages to it, do not care which server the entity object in which physical machine. Its implementation principle is also very simple, ET framework provides a location server, all mounted MailBoxComponent entity objects will be registered to the location server with their id and location, other servers to send messages to this entity object if you do not know the location of the entity object, will first go to the location server query, query the location and then send.
### 6. Provide server non-stop dynamic update logic function  
hot is an indispensable feature of the game server , ET framework using the component design , you can make the Watchtower design , the component only members , no methods , all the methods made to extend the method into the hot more dll , reload the dll at runtime to hot more all logic .
### 7. Client use C# hot update, hot update one key switch  
You can use csharp.lua or ILRuntime to do client-side hot update with a little modification. No need to use shit lua anymore, client can realize all logic hot update, including protocol, config, ui and so on.  
### 8. Client-side hot reload  
Development without restarting the client can modify the client logic code, development is extremely convenient  

### 9. Client-side server in the same language and share code  
Download the ET framework , open the server-side project , you can see that the server side references the client side of a lot of code , through the reference to the client code to achieve a dual-side shared code . For example, the network messages between the client-side and the server-side completely share a file, add a message only need to modify once.  
### 10. KCP ENET TCP Websocket protocol seamless switching  
ET framework not only supports TCP, but also supports reliable UDP protocols (ENET and KCP), ENet is the network library used by League of Legends, which is characterized by fast and very good performance in the case of network packet loss, which we have tested TCP in the case of packet loss of 5%, the moba game on the card can not be, but using ENet, packet loss of 20% will still not feel card. Very powerful. Framework also supports the use of KCP protocol, KCP is also a reliable UDP protocol, said to be better than ENET performance, please note that the use of kcp, you need to add their own heartbeat mechanism, otherwise 20 seconds did not receive the packet, the server will be disconnected. The protocol can be switched seamlessly.  
### 11. 3D Recast pathfinding function  
Unity can export scene data to the server side to do recast pathfinding. Very convenient to do MMO, demo demonstrates the server-side 3d pathfinding function  
### 12. server-side support for repl, you can also dynamically execute a new code  
This can print out any data in the process, greatly simplifying the difficulty of finding problems on the server side, open the repl method, enter repl directly in the console to enter repl mode  
### 13. Provide client-side bot framework support  
A few lines of code to create a robot to log into the game. Robot pressure testing is a breeze, the robot is exactly the same as the normal player, use the robot to do a good pressure test before going online, greatly reducing the chance of crashing online   
### 14. AI framework  
ET's AI framework makes AI writing even easier than UI.     
### 15. Test case framework  
Unlike the test cases on the market, ET's test cases are a complete game environment, for the protocol level, no need to engage in a variety of interfaces to mock. write up very quickly    


### 16. There are many, many more features that I won't go into detail about  
a. and its convenient to check the CPU occupation and memory leak check, vs comes with analysis tools, no longer have to worry about performance and memory leak check  
b. The use of NLog library, playing log and its convenience, the usual development, you can play all the server log to a file, no longer have to search for logs one file at a time  
c.Unify the use of Mongodb bson serialization, messages and configuration files are all bson or json, and later use mongodb to do the database, no longer need to do the format conversion.  
d. Provide a synchronization tool  

ET framework is a powerful and flexible distributed server-side architecture that can fully meet the needs of most large games. Use this framework, the client developer can complete their own dual-ended development, saving a lot of manpower and resources, saving a lot of communication time.

Vytek/MayaVerse,C#,"# NEW VERSION:

https://github.com/Vytek/MayaVerse03

# MayaVerse
MayaVerse is an experimental Metaverse - Immersive Virtual World

This document describes the development and creation of the first Immersive Virtual World. MayaVerse will be a fully immersive computer recreated universe. It will be developed using the best technologies available to overcome the current paradigm of the ""Immersive Virtual Worlds"" and launch the user in a new vision.
What will be outlined is actually an idea, a project that we hope will soon become a reality. We believe il will be soon a reality, hoping that drawing a plot and describing what are the possibilities will encourage further progress and implementations.

Let's start from the correct definition of ""MayaVerse"":
3D immersive virtual environment recreated by computer, shared with multiple users over the Internet with a persistent possibility of insertion , modification and deletion of objects and agents and direct interaction through virtual devices. Furthermore programmable through a scripting language.
The above definition only partially clarifies the possibilities offered by a Metaverse. Here, then, is a brief ""manifesto"" that can detail more the characteristics of the MayaVerse project.
A micro manifesto for the perfect ""Metaverse"":

* Immersive Virtual Reality: Immersive Virtual Reality, designed for a sense of ""presence"" and ""interaction"" at a high level. One should not think of a simple HMD viewer connected to an environment recreated on the computer, but of a platform that ""involves"" the user and above all gives him the possibility of interacting with other users, with objects and also with automatic systems or systems guided by Artificial Intelligence.

* Open Source/Royalty Free protocols, standards, queues: the entire Metaverse source code should be released under Open Source lincense, but above all based on standards and non-proprietary protocols, open and certified by international bodies. Examples are the VRML standards and its evolution X3D which, however, after a period of good diffusion, have been ""forgotten"" by the IT industry. Recently, Carmack has also underlined this possibility with the creation of an open standard for describing a 3D scene and its transfer through the internet via glTF.

* Sandboxing User Generated contents In-World/Out-World: the ability to offer users tools for creating and editing any content within the virtualized environment is essential. The ability to import creations from other systems and software is also a goal that amplifies users' creativity and offers an unprecedented level of interaction. All current ""Metaverse"" offer this opportunity at various levels, which can then be specialized to create games, experiments and artistic forms of all kinds.

* Scripting system using software language as Javascript, C#, Go, Swift: directly correlated with the previous point is the need to program the entire environment through high-level languages. C#, Go and Swift seem to be perfect candidates even though the scene is currently dominated by Javascript. However, it is essential to give developers the option of creating links, automatically modifying the environment and interfacing it with other systems and platforms.

* Metaverse as protocol not only as API: it is quite obvious to think that the Metaverse exposes APIs, but it is even more important to assume and design a real protocol that allows different Metaverses to communicate with each other. . In the past, there have been several attempts such as MMOX, which has failed to overcome the draft state of the IETF.

* Crypto Currency inside Metaverse: Why not use Bitcoin or Ethereum directly? Despite many ads, still no Metaverse uses Crypto-currencies any kind to allow trade between users. This feature would instead make the platform unique and above all would involve the user more closely.

* Decentralized architectures: Almost all platforms for virtual worlds are based on classic client-server architecture. Moving to a peer-to-peer system would have enormous advantages. JanusVR, for example, allows you to use the incredible ipfs (Inter-Planetary File System) for the fast recovery of different assets.

Implementation of the Alfa version
The software is currently only developed for Windows platform.
The current Client system is based on SW:

3D Graphics Engine: Unity3D 2017.1.1f01

See list below

All server-side code relies on opensource services and software for Linux Server.
The tests were carried out on the following HW VR:

 - HTC Live 1.2 
 - OculusRift CV1

# What is HyperCube

HyperCube is a free and open source blockchain project for everyone to use.


[HyperCube Wiki](https://github.com/hypercube-lab/hypercube/wiki)

[HyperCube Whitepaper](https://github.com/hypercube-lab/hypercube/blob/main/HyperCube.pdf)



# What does HyperCube Do?

HyperCube is an Ethereum 2-layer solution based on proof of POD dedication and an independent public chain.

# What Consensus Algorithm does HyperCube use?

HyperCube's network is an independent public chain written in Rust language based on PoD consensus.

PoD is a new network consensus algorithm based on a hybrid consensus of PoW (ETHash) and PoS (Dedication Formula), which determines the blockchain network accounting privileges from multi-dimensional parameters such as time, network coupling, community participation, and online time.

The PoD consensus + XPZ public chain helps Ethereum increase network transaction speed and reduce Gas fees. At the same time, the introduction of the EVERNET permanent storage network can provide decentralized permanent storage space for financial infrastructure, the Internet of Things, and the Internet.

# Who is behind HyperCube?

HyperCube is developed by HyperCube Lab. HyperCube Lab is responsible for designing, coding and maintaining the HyperCube code base. 

HyperCube Lab is a DAO organization which is funded and guided by Apex Dex Foundation (ADF). 

ADF is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting blockchain and other technology for the well-being of entire human race.

#  Origin of HyperCube

The XPZ development team is guided by multiple Turing Award winners as consultants, and the Ethereum technical team guides the development. Grayscale and Coinbase fragments. XPZ, under the joint promotion of many geek technology enthusiasts and teams around the world, actively explores the new Ethereum The road to expansion.

The XPZ (full name HyperCube) public chain supports large-scale, multi-threaded, multi-concurrent network computing and storage capabilities such as NFT casting, social tokens, DeFi, and financial applications.

# Who to Participate in HyperCube?

As HyperCube is under active development, and is going to release a testnet, for now the eaiest way to participate is running an HyperCube node.

#  HyperCube Node Rig

All the underlying infrastructure of HyperCube is powered by nodes, aka miners. User can use household machine to run a XPZ node. All XPZ miner is based on the dual-core mining mode of Nvdia and AMD. Based on the special structure of PoD, XPZ can conduct joint mining with ETH, which saves energy and achieves the goal of carbon neutrality on the chain.

After XPZ upgrades the perpetual storage network, large-scale on-chain low-cost storage can be realized, which provides a guarantee for permanent storage of data by facilitating hard disk storage space.


#  Core Advantages of HyperCube

* Support game financial GameFi, chain games, decentralized financial DeFi, XPZ system built-in Athena SDK, can help develop the rapid development of GameFi and DeFi products.

* XPZ core provides EVM general XVM (XPZ virtual machine), which is faster than EVM and enables Ethereum developers to get started quickly

* Low gas fee, fast response

* Athena SDK can provide fast casting NFT, low-cost digital art creation

* Anonymous social application. HyperCube provides an inhouse built application called QuntumnChat, which provides Decentralized IDentifier, On-Chain Messaging, QuntumnChat supports anonymous social, OTC and token storage, facilitating quick realization of NFT creators, and supporting the issuance of social tokens and personal NFT works

* XPZ supports a hybrid on-chain transaction engine based on order books and automated market makers, which can help DeFi to be implemented on a large scale

* Strong academic background: PoD and XPZ core technologies have passed peer review and will be released in international academic conferences soon

* Endorsed by IEEE and other international blockchain standard organizations

* Traditional American capital includes endorsement

# Future of HyperCube

HyperCube is designed as the next generation infrascture for Metaverse and AI. 

In order to prompot HyperCube technology and making mass adoption of blockchain technology possbile, SuperFulx Quntumn (SQ) is formed by Apex Dex Foundation (ADF). SQ is not actively researching various key technology using blockchain technology, for which will be disclosed 

In our vision, HyperCube will be widely used as a key infrastructure for various industries, like Finance, Manufacturing, Transportation, Entertainment and Goverment, providing vital support of computing power and storage capability.

# Vault

HyperCube will pre-farm a 210 million of XPZ at network launch, these 210 million XPZ will be stored in Vault.

The purpose of these 210 million XPZ is to help stabilize and grow the XPZ economy through DAO governance model. For the 210 million XPZ, 90% will be frozen until 2031.

# Regarding ICO

HyperCube has no ICO plans.

SQ wants the company's equity listed on an American exchange. We can make enforceable representations about how SQ intends to utilize the Vault using corporate controls. XPZ is a utility token, not an investment. So when mainnet launches, SQ aims to undertake an SEC registered stock IPO.

# Code Coverage

To generate code coverage statistics:

```bash
$ scripts/coverage.sh
$ open target/cov/lcov-local/index.html
```

Why coverage? While most see coverage as a code quality metric, we see it primarily as a developer
productivity metric. When a developer makes a change to the codebase, presumably it's a *solution* to
some problem.  Our unit-test suite is how we encode the set of *problems* the codebase solves. Running
the test suite should indicate that your change didn't *infringe* on anyone else's solutions. Adding a
test *protects* your solution from future changes. Say you don't understand why a line of code exists,
try deleting it and running the unit-tests. The nearest test failure should tell you what problem
was solved by that code. If no test fails, go ahead and submit a Pull Request that asks, ""what
problem is solved by this code?"" On the other hand, if a test does fail and you can think of a
better way to solve the same problem, a Pull Request with your solution would most certainly be
welcome! Likewise, if rewriting a test can better communicate what code it's protecting, please
send us that patch!

other persons using the HyperCube blockchain protocol may be sanctioned
persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of
U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to
individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that
deploy, integrate, or use the HyperCube blockchain protocol code directly
(e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the HyperCube
blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or qtc

## 本项目的实现过程
### 云服务器部分
- 参考[https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/2279551](http://https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/2279551)

- 我用的阿里云的云服务器，也可以考虑其他云服务或者是外网可访问的服务器资源。

- 进入服务器终端，在终端输入以下命令（注：确保输入的端口是对外开放的，WECHATY_TOKEN请填写自己的token）


```python
$ apt update

$ apt install docker.io

$ docker pull wechaty/wechaty:latest

$ export WECHATY_LOG=""verbose""

$ export WECHATY_PUPPET=""wechaty-puppet-wechat""

$ export WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVER_PORT=""8080""

$ export WECHATY_TOKEN=""puppet_padlocal_xxxxxx"" # 这里输入你自己的token

$ docker run -ti --name wechaty_puppet_service_token_gateway --rm -e WECHATY_LOG -e WECHATY_PUPPET -e WECHATY_TOKEN -e WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVER_PORT -p ""$WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVER_PORT:$WECHATY_PUPPET_SERVER_PORT"" wechaty/wechaty:latest
```

- 输入网址: https://api.chatie.io/v0/hosties/xxxxxx (后面的xxxxxx是自己的token)，如果返回了服务器的ip地址以及端口号，就说明运行成功了   

- 运行后会输出一大堆东西，找到一个Online QR Code: 的地址点击进去，会出现二维码，微信扫码登录，最终手机上显示桌面微信已登录，即可。


### 环境安装

```python
!pip install -U paddlepaddle -i https://mirror.baidu.com/pypi/simple
!python -m pip install --upgrade paddlenlp -i https://pypi.org/simple
!pip install --upgrade pip
!pip install --upgrade sentencepiece 
!pip install wechaty
```

### 文本匹配部分

- 文本语义匹配是NLP最基础的任务之一，简单来说就是判断两段文本的语义相似度。应用场景广泛，比如搜索引擎、智能问答、知识检索、信息流推荐等。

- 为什么要用上这个功能呢，因为如果我们直接基于关键词匹配去判断用户需求的话，可能会出现理解错误的情况。比如如果用户输入“我可讨厌星座了”，但是聊天机器人可能还是会给用户展示星座超能力；如果直接限于关键词“星座”严格匹配的话，那用户如果不小心多输入一个字或者标点符号都不能实现想要的功能，太不友好了。因此本项目利用文本匹配技术来判断用户是否真实需要查看星座未来超能力的功能。

- 本次项目基于 PaddleNLP，使用百度开源的预训练模型 ERNIE1.0，构建语义匹配模型，来判断 2 个文本语义是否相同。

- 从头训练一个模型的关键步骤有数据加载、数据预处理、模型搭建、模型训练和评估，具体可参照[https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/1972174](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/projectdetail/1972174)，
在这我们就直接调用已经训练好的语义匹配模型进行应用。


- 下载已经训练好的语义匹配模型, 并解压


```python
! wget https://paddlenlp.bj.bcebos.com/models/text_matching/pointwise_matching_model.tar
! tar -xvf pointwise_matching_model.tar
```

- 具体代码部分（match.py文件）


### 对话闲聊部分
- 近年来，人机对话系统受到了学术界和产业界的广泛关注。开放域对话系统希望机器可以流畅自然地与人进行交互，既可以进行日常问候类的闲聊，又可以完成特定功能。
- 随着深度学习技术的不断发展，聊天机器人变得越来越智能。我们可以通过机器人来完成一些机械性的问答工作，也可以在闲暇时和智能机器人进行对话，他们的出现让生活变得更丰富多彩。
- 本项目载入该功能，也是希望人们可以在寂寞无聊的时候有个聊天的小伙伴，虽然有时候他可能会不知所云，但他永远会在那等你。

- 具体代码部分（chat.py文件）

- PaddleNLP针对生成式任务提供了generate()函数，内嵌于PaddleNLP所有的生成式模型。支持Greedy Search、Beam Search和Sampling解码策略，用户只需指定解码策略以及相应的参数即可完成预测解码，得到生成的sequence的token ids以及概率得分。
- PaddleNLP对于各种预训练模型已经内置了相应的tokenizer，指定想要使用的模型名字即可加载对应的tokenizer。
- PaddleNLP提供了GPT,UnifiedTransformer等中文预训练模型，可以通过预训练模型名称完成一键加载。这次用的是一个小的中文GPT预训练模型。其他预训练模型请参考[模型列表](https://paddlenlp.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/model_zoo/transformers.html)。

### 主函数部分（main.py）
- 星座今日运势需要自己申请一下接口，网址：[星座运势](https://www.tianapi.com/apiview/78)，将你申请到的APIKEY填入values['key']
- 运行本函数的时候，不要忘记云服务器也要开启哦，这样你的微信号才能变身为算命大师哦，不然只能在本地感受了。

## 后记

**项目可改进的部分**

- 闲聊模型不够强大，会出现不知所云的情况，又或者更偏向于文本续写而不是对话。甚至会出现不太好的话语，这应该是训练语料导致的，模型预训练时语料没有清洗，以后可以考虑用干净的更符合本项目的对话语料微调。
- 对话语义匹配的调用方式过于单调，希望之后可以改进。
- 功能还不够多，结合paddle提供的优秀资源还可以创造出更多更好玩的功能。

**互相交流进步**

smsithlord/aarcade-source-legacy,C++,
zestymarket/billboard,JavaScript,"# zesty-sdk

The Zesty SDK allows developers to integrate their app into the Zesty Network. More docs: https://docs.zesty.market

Currently, we support the following platforms:

- [aframe](https://github.com/zestymarket/zesty-sdk/tree/main/aframe)
- [babylon.js](https://github.com/zestymarket/zesty-sdk/tree/main/babylonjs)
- [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/zestymarket/zesty-sdk/tree/main/r3f)
- [three.js](https://github.com/zestymarket/zesty-sdk/tree/main/threejs)
- [web](https://github.com/zestymarket/zesty-sdk/tree/main/web)
- [wonderland](https://github.com/zestymarket/zesty-sdk/tree/main/wonderland)

## What's Zesty?

Zesty is an open and permissionless monetization protocol for creators of content. It is open in the sense that anyone can integrate our SDK to monetize their apps, without the permission of a centralized authority.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo and run `yarn` at the top level. This repo is set up with yarn workspaces, so doing this will install modules for all of the different SDKs.
- Work on whichever SDKs are relevant to you.
- Run `yarn build` at the top level to build all the SDKs at once.
- Run `yarn test` to run unit tests.
  - (Optional) Run `yarn prepare` to set up a pre-commit hook to run tests.

## Publishing to NPM

If you've developed a new framework SDK and want to publish it to NPM, the steps are as follows:

- Ensure you are a member of the zestymarket org on NPM.
- Ensure that the name in the package.json for the SDK follows the `@zestymarket/<framework>-sdk` format.
- In the directory for that SDK, run `npm publish --access public` and the SDK will be published to the zestymarket NPM org.

LifeScopeLabs/lifescope-xr,JavaScript,"# LifeScope XR

## Running locally

### Install node_modules
Run npm install or yarn install (npm or yarn must already be installed).

## Create config files
You'll need to create two new files in the config folder called dev.json and production.json.
The gitignore contains these filenames, so there's no chance of accidentally committing them.

These new config files only needs a few lines, because the 'config' library first pulls everything from 'default.json' and then overrides anything that it finds in other config files it uses.
The config files should look like this:

```
{
 ""mongodb"": {
""address"": ""<insert address>""
 }
}
```

### Start server
Just run 

```npm run build-dev```

and then

```npm run dev```

This will use the 'dev' configuration, so make sure you've created a dev.json file in the config folder.

## Location of Kubernetes scripts

The following parts of this guide reference Kubernetes/Kustomize configuration scripts. 
These scripts are all located in [a separate repository](https://github.com/lifescopelabs/lifescope-kubernetes).

## Building and running on a local Minikube installation via Kubernetes

### Containerize XR server via Docker and run in a Kubernetes Cluster
The LifeScope XR server can be run in a Kubernetes Cluster via containerizing the code with Docker.

Containerized builds of the dev codebase can be found on LifeScope Labs' Docker hub, ```lifescopelabs/lifescope-xr:vX.Y.Z-dev```.
If you want to build your own, you have two options: build into Minikube's local Docker registry, or build locally and push
to a Docker Hub you control. 

*Because dev environments are run differently than production environments, they need to have a different Docker image
than the ones used in production. As a result, dev images are, by custom, appended with '-dev' in the name, as seen above.*

### 1a. Point shell to Minikube's local Docker registry (optional)

By default, Docker uses a distinct local registry when building images.
Minikube has its own local Docker registry, and by default will pull images from Docker Hub into its registry
before spinning up instances of those images.
You can point your Linux/Mac shell to the Minikube registry so that Docker builds directly into Minikube via the following:
```eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)```

If you do this, you can skip the following step and go directly to 'Containerize the API with Docker'.

### 1b. Set up Docker Hub account and install Docker on your machine (optional)
*LifeScope has a Docker Hub account with repositories for images of each of the applications that make up the service.
The Kubernetes scripts are coded to pull specific versions from the official repos.
If you're just pulling the official images, you don't need to set up your own Hub or repositories therein.*

*If you followed the previous section and pointed your shell to Minikube's local Docker registry, definitely skip
this step, as it's completely unnecessary.*

This guide will not cover how to set up a Docker Hub account or a local copy of Docker since the instructions provided 
by the makers of those services are more than sufficient.
Once you've created a Docker Hub account, you'll need to make public repositories for each of the lifescope services you
want to run. At the very least, you'll want to run lifescope-api, lifescope-app, and lifescope-xr and the Docker Hubs for those are 
most easily named ```lifescope-api```and ```lifescope-app```, and ```lifescope-xr```. 
If you use different names, you'll have to change the image names in the Kubernetes config files in the 
lifescope-kubernetes sub-directories for those services.

### 2. Containerize the XR server with Docker (optional)

*LifeScope has a Docker Hub account with repositories for images of each of the applications that make up the service.
The Kubernetes scripts are coded to pull specific versions from the official repos.
If you want to pull from a repo you control, do the following:*

After installing Docker on your machine, from the top level of this application run ```docker build -t <Docker Hub username>/lifescope-xr:vX.Y.Z-dev .```.
X,Y, and Z should be the current version of the XR server, though it's not required that you tag the image with a version.

You'll then need to push this image to Docker Hub so that the Kubernetes deployment can get the proper image.
Within lifescope-kubernetes/lifescope-xr/base/lifescope-xr.yaml, you'll see a few instances of an image name that points to an image name, something along
the lines of lifescopelabs/lifescope-xr:v1.1.0. Each instance of this will need to be changed to <Docker Hub username>/<public repo name>:<version name>.
For example, if your username is 'cookiemonstar' and you're building v4.5.2 of the XR server, you'd change the 'image' field 
wherever it occurs in base/lifescope-xr.yaml to ```cookiemonstar/lifescope-xr:v4.5.2-dev```.
This should match everything following the '-t' in the build command.

Once the image is built, you can push it to Docker Hub by running ```docker push <imagename>```, e.g. ```docker push cookiemonstar/lifescope-xr:v4.5.2-dev```.
If you're using Minikube's Docker registry, skip this push command because Minikube already has the image.
You're now ready to deploy the XR server pod.

### Run XR server Kustomize script

*Before running this, make sure that you have the dev.json file from the config folder in lifescope-kubernetes/lifescope-xr/base*

From the top level of the lifescope-kubernetes repo, run ```kubectl apply -k lifescope-xr/base```.

If this ran properly, you should be able to go to api.dev.lifescope.io/gql-p and see the GraphQL Playground running. 

## Building and running in a cloud production environment

### Obtain SSL certificate
IF you want your server to be secure, you'll need to purchase a domain name and then register the domain or subdomain 
that you want to use for LifeScope with Amazon Certificate Manager.

When you have the certificate from ACM, make note of its ARN.
Look in the production Nginx config for the Service that will be set up.
Look for the field metadata -> annotations -> service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert
You will need to replace the value here with the ARN of the certificate you generated.

### Install node_modules
Run npm install or yarn install (npm or yarn must already be installed).

### Containerize XR server via Docker and run in a Kubernetes Cluster
The LifeScope XR server can be run in a Kubernetes Cluster via containerizing the code with Docker.

Containerized builds of the codebase can be found on LifeScope Labs' Docker hub, ```lifescopelabs/lifescope-xr:vX.Y.Z```.
If you want to build your own, you will need to build an image locally and push to a Docker Hub you control.

#### Containerize the XR server with Docker (optional)

The Kubernetes scripts are coded to pull specific versions from the official repos.
If you want to pull from a repo you control, do the following:*

After installing Docker on your machine, from the top level of this application run ```docker build -t <Docker Hub username>/lifescope-xr:vX.Y.Z .```.
X,Y, and Z should be the current version of the XR server, though it's not required that you tag the image with a version.

You'll then need to push this image to Docker Hub so that the Kubernetes deployment can get the proper image.
Within lifescope-kubernetes/lifescope-xr/overlaye/production/lifescope-xr.yaml, you'll see a few instances of an image name that points to an image name, something along
the lines of lifecsopelabs/lifescope-xr:v1.1.0. Each instance of this will need to be changed to <Docker Hub username>/<public repo name>:<version name>.
For example, if your username is 'cookiemonstar' and you're building v4.5.2 of the XR server, you'd change the 'image' field 
wherever it occurs in lifescope-kubernetes/lifescope-xr/overlays/production/lifescope-xr to ```cookiemonstar/lifescope-xr:v4.5.2```.
This should match everything following the '-t' in the build command.

Once the image is built, you can push it to Docker Hub by running ```docker push <imagename>```, e.g. ```docker push cookiemonstar/lifescope-xr:v4.5.2```.
You're now ready to deploy the Kubernetes cluster.

### Deploy Kubernetes cluster and XR server pod
This guide is copied almost verbatim in lifescope-app and lifescope-api, so if you've already set up either of those, you can skip straight to
running the lifescope-xr Kustomize script.

### Install eksctl and create Fargate cluster
Refer to [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html) for how to set up
eksctl.

The script to provision the Fargate cluster is located in the lifescope-kubernetes repo.
To provision the Fargate cluster, from the top level of lifescope-kubernetes run ```eksctl create cluster -f aws-fargate/production/aws-cluster.yaml```.

When the cluster has been provisioned, 

### Run Nginx script and provision DNS routing to Load Balancer

From the top level of the lifescope-kubernetes repo, run ```kubectl apply -k lifescope-nginx/overlays/production```.
This will install nginx in your K8s cluster. After a minute or so the Load Balancer that is set up will have provisioned
an external IP, which you can get by running ```kubectl get service -n nginx-ingress``` and looking in the column 'EXTERNAL-IP'.

This external IP will need to be used in a few places.

First, go to [AWS Route53 -> Hosted zones](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/home?#hosted-zones:).
Create a Hosted Zone for the top-level domain you're using.
Within that, create a Record Set. The Name can be left blank, Type should be 'A - IPv4 address', set Alias to 'Yes',
and under Alias Target enter 'dualstack.<external-IP>' (if you click on the text box for Alias Target, a prompt scrollable box
should pop up with various resources you have in AWS; the Load Balancer for Nginx should be under 'ELB Classic load balancers'
and if clicked on it should autocomplete everything properly). Click Create when this is all entered.

Next, you'll need to make a CNAME with your domain registrar from 'xr' and 'nxr' and any other lifescope services you're
setting up (api, app, embed) to the external IP.

#### Run XR server Kustomize script

*Before running this, make sure that you have the dev.json file from the config folder in lifescope-kubernetes/lifescope-xr/base
and the production.json file from the config folder in lifescope-kubernetes/lifescope-xr/overlays/production.
dev.json won't be used, but due to a deficiency in Kustomize as of writing this it's impossible to tell it to ignore the 
base instruction of secretizing dev.json.*

From the top level of the lifescope-kubernetes repo, run ```kubectl apply -k lifescope-xr/overlays/production```.

There's no external way to see if this worked since the server doesn't communicate to the outside world, but you can run

```kubectl get pods -A``` 

to see all of the running pods and look for one named 'lifescope-xr-<random characters>-<more random characters>'.

20 seconds or so post-startup its status should be 'Running' and the Ready status should be '1/1'.

GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse,TeX,"# Metaverse

## Purpose

The Metaverse repository was created to explore ways that small and medium sized enterprises could benefit from secure economic activity within global metaverse applications. It is not a turnkey solution but rather a collection of literature, free and open-source software, and best practice. It is designed to inform a curious company using a [single book format resource](https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse/raw/draft/Book/metaverseBTC.pdf), and a [how-to guide](https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse/tree/main/Lab).

The most up to date direct PDF download is [direct linked here](https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse/raw/draft/Book/metaverseBTC.pdf), and you should use this if you just arrived from Twitter etc.

This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) GM Cyber Foundry Project (15R18P02426)

</dl>

## See a Demo

Check out [Virtual Reign Immersive Chess](https://vreign.space/auth/login) - this Immers Server is connected to a chess
game built on top of Mozilla Hubs. 


## Get Started

1. Spin up your Immers Server using an [immers-app template](https://github.com/immers-space/immers-app)
2. Add the [immers-client](https://github.com/immers-space/immers-client) to your WebXR project to connect to it
3. [Join our community on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#immers-space:matrix.org) for help & discussion
4. [Join our Platform Cooperative](https://opencollective.com/immers-space/contribute/creator-member-33683) to guide the future of the project

We provide a [Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/immersspace/immers) for immers,
and the [immers-app repo](https://github.com/immers-space/immers-app) contains
docker-compose configuration, configuration script, and deploy instructions for various setups.
If you prefer to run immers without docker, it can be deployed just like
any other NodeJS & MongoDB app.

If using with Hubs Cloud, but not using our docker config & Hubs deployer,
[see Manual Hubs Cloud Config](#manual-hubs-cloud-config) section below.

## Configuration

Immers looks for the following configuration values as environment variables
or in a `.env` file in the project root.

## Required configuration

Variable | Value | Example
--- | --- | ---
adminEmail | e-mail of user with administrative privileges | none
name | Name of your immer | Immers Space
domain | Domain name for your immers server | immers.space
hub | Domain name for your Mozilla Hubs Cloud or other connected immersive experience. Can either be a single domain or comma separated list. Each domain listed will be enabled for CORS & trusted OAuth client requests. Users will be redirected to the first domain listed. | hub.immers.space
dbString | Full MongoDB connection string, with credentials and database name, e.g. `mongodb://localhost:27017/immers`
smtpHost | Mail service domain (for password resets) | smtp.sendgrid.net
smtpPort | Mail service port | 587
smtpUser | Mail service username | apikey
smtpPassword | Mail service password |
sessionSecret | Secret key for session cookie encryption | *Automatically generated when [using setup script](https://github.com/immers-space/immers-app#step-1---setup)*
easySecret | Secret key for email token encryption | *Automatically generated when [using setup script](https://github.com/immers-space/immers-app#step-1---setup)*
userFiles | Path to storage location for user-uploaded files | `uploads/`


## Optional configuration

Variable | Value | Default
--- | --- | ---
homepage | Redirect root html requests to this url | Use `hub` url
googleFont | Font family name from to fetch from Google Fonts for immer name header | Monoton
backgroundColor | CSS color | #a6549d
backgroundImage | Image file | vapor.png
customCSS | Additional CSS file to load | None
icon | Image file | vaporwave-icon.png
imageAttributionText | Attribution for backgroundImage, if needed | Vectors by Vecteezy
imageAttributionUrl | Attribution for backgroundImage, if needed | https://www.vecteezy.com/free-vector/vector
maxUploadSize | Limit on media upload file size in Mb | 20
monetizationPointer | [Payment pointer](https://webmonetization.org/docs/ilp-wallets/#payment-pointers) for Web Monetization on login & profile pages | Immers Space organization wallet
port | Port number for immers sever | 8081
smtpFrom | From address for emails | noreplay@mail.`domain`
emailOptInURL | Link to an opt-in form for email updates to show on registration page | None
emailOptInParam | Query parameter for `emailOptInURL` for the e-mail address | Use opt-in url without inserting e-mail
emailOptInNameParam | Query parameter for `emailOptInURL` for the name | Use opt-in url without inserting name
systemUserName | Username for a ""Service"" type actor representing the Immer, enables welcome messages and [Mastodon secure mode](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/#secure-mode) compatibility | none (does not create service actor)
systemDisplayName | Sets the display name for the service actor | none
welcome | HTML file for a message that will be delivered from the system user to new user's inboxes (requires `systemUserName`) | none (does not send message)
keyPath, certPath, caPath | Local development only. Relative paths to certificate files | None
proxyMode | Enable use behind an SSL-terminating proxy or load balancer, serves over http instead of https and sets Express `trust proxy` setting to the value of `proxyMode` (e.g. `1`, [other options](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html)) | none (serves over https with AutoEncrypt)
enablePublicRegistration | Allow new user self-registration | true
enableClientRegistration | Allow new remote immers servers to register - if this is `false`, users will not be able to login with their accounts from other servers unless that server is already registered | true

**Notes on use with a reverse proxy**: When setting `proxyMode`, you must ensure your reverse proxy sets the following headers: X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-Proto (example for nginx below). If you are load balancing multiple immers server instances, you will also need to setup sticky sessions in order for streaming updates to work. 

```
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
```

## API access

Most API access will be done with the [immers-client](https://github.com/immers-space/immers-client)
library on your immersive website, but the immers server also attempts to
parse your `domain` option to set the login
session cookie on the apex domain so that it can be used in CORS requests.
As long as your immers server and immersive website are on the same apex domain,
e.g. immers.space and hub.immers.space, then you can make authenticated requests
with the `credentials: 'include'` fetch option.

Restore session for previously logged in user:

```js
let user
const token = await fetch('https://your.immer/auth/token', { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include' })
    .then(res => {
        if (!res.ok) {
            // 401 if not logged in
            return undefined
        }
        return res.text()
    })
if (token) {
    user = await window.fetch(`https://your.immer/auth/me`, {
    headers: {
      Accept: 'application/activity+json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
    }
  }).then(res => res.json());
}
```

Log out of session without having to navigate to immers profile page:

```js
fetch('https://your.immer/auth/logout', { method: 'POST', credentials: 'include' })
```

## Controlled Accounts

If you have an existing user account system, you may not want to bother users with having
another account for immers features. In this case, you can setup a service account
with total authority to create users, login as them, and act on their behalf.

[Controlled accounts docs](./doc/ControlledAccounts.md)


## Manual Hubs Cloud Config

These steps are not necessary if you're using our docker Hubs deployer.
If you aren't, you'll need to add the following in Hubs Cloud admin -> setup -> sever settings -> advanced


* Extra room Header HTML: `<meta name=""env:immers_server"" content=""https://your.immers.server"">`
(replace value in content with your immers server url)
* Extra Content Security Policy connect-src Rules: `https: wss:`
(allows API and streaming connections to remote users home instances)
* Allowed CORS origins: `*`
(temporary measure cross-hub for avatar sharing)

## Local dev

immers

* Clone and install immers
```
git clone https://github.com/immers-space/immers.git
cd immers
npm ci
```
* Install a self-signed certificate
```
mkdir certs
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout certs/server.key -out certs/server.cert
sudo chown $USER certs/*
```
* Install [mongodb](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
* Run immer with `npm run dev:server` 

hubs

* Clone and install our fork
```
git clone https://github.com/immers-space/hubs.git
cd hubs
git checkout immers-integration
npm ci
npm run build:client
```
* Run hub with either `npm run dev` (use Hubs dev networking servers) or `npm run start` (to connect to your hubs cloud networking server).
* Visit you immer at `https://localhost:8081`, approve the certificate exception, get automatically forwarded to your hub at `https://localhost:8080`, approve another certificate exception, create a room, and you will be redirected to login or register with your immer.

Default immers server is `https://localhost:8081`, override with entry `IMMERS_SERVER` in hubs repo root folder `.env` file.

If working on immers server web client, run both `npm run dev:client` and `npm run dev:server` at the same time.

### Creating a new release

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` - Update top section header from ""Unreleased"" to ""vx.x.x (yyyy-mm-dd)"" with the version and date of the new release
2. Update package version: `npm version [patch|minor|major]`
3. Build new docker image: `npm run build:image`
4. Login to docker hub: `docker login -u your_user_name` (if needed)
5. Publish new docker image: `npm run publish:image`

*TDN: Let data transfer safely, make the network stable, secure, and highly available.*

As the network interconnection, TDN includes peer-to-peer, centralized gateway, proxy & relay service, LAN, RPC, Near, etc.

As the framework of decentralized applications, TDN uses the `Layer` and `Group` models. We built this framework because we feel that the blockchain is very limited. If you want a more open and free distributed application development technology, and Pluggable, lightweight application framework, TDN can satisfy you.

## Example
```
use std::sync::Arc;
use tdn::prelude::*;
use tdn::types::rpc::{json, RpcError, RpcHandler, RpcParam};

struct State(u32);

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (peer_addr, send, mut out_recv) = start().await.unwrap();
    println!(""Example: peer id: {:?}"", peer_addr);

    let mut rpc_handler = RpcHandler::new(State(1));
    rpc_handler.add_method(""say_hello"", |_params: Vec<RpcParam>, state: Arc<State>| async move {
        assert_eq!(1, state.0);
        Ok(HandleResult::rpc(json!(""hello"")))
    });

    while let Some(message) = out_recv.recv().await {
        match message {
            ReceiveMessage::Own(msg) => match msg {
                RecvType::Connect(peer, _data) => {
                    println!(""receive own peer {} join"", peer.id.short_show());
                }
                RecvType::Leave(peer) => {
                    println!(""receive own peer {} leave"", peer.id.short_show());
                }
                RecvType::Event(peer_id, _data) => {
                    println!(""receive own event from {}"", peer_id.short_show());
                }
                _ => {
                    println!(""nerver here!"")
                }
            },
            ReceiveMessage::Group(msg) => match msg {
                RecvType::Connect(peer, _data) => {
                    println!(""receive group peer {} join"", peer.id.short_show());
                }
                RecvType::Result(..) => {

                    println!(""receive group event from {}"", peer_id.short_show());
                }

### Core QA
1. **What is Layers & Groups?**
Simply `Group` is application, one application is one group, `Layer` is communication between apps. In the Group, users can define everything. The Layer is divided into upper and lower, upper is this application depends on others, lower is others depends on this. If app is an independent application that does not interact with other applications, then you can completely ignore Layer.

2. **Different consensus?**
Consensus is expensive. Not all applications require global consensus to be used. Local consensus can speed up the usability of applications. Local consensus can be different. Users can define self-consensus in different applications. The results of the consensus can also be sent to different applications through the layer. In this way, the consensus results can be passed to the upper layer. After the upper layer consensus is obtained, a larger range and stronger consensus irreversible result can be formed.

3. **Different permission?**
Why do we need a different permission mechanism? Because in different applications, some applications require an open permissionless environment, such as Bitcoin, and some require a permissioned environment. For example, We built a synchronization which is distributed between my own devices is inaccessible to outsiders. At the same time, `Layer` supports applications in different permission environments, allowing data interaction.

4. **Different block & transaction data structure?**
Similarly, different applications have completely different data structures. Therefore, in the TDN, we use a common byte stream format. Users can customize the data format of the application. The communication with the TDN is only serialization and deserialization.

5. **Different account system?**
In the TDN, there will be a default p2p network address (PeerId) in the p2p system. The user can use the PeerId to replace the ip address. The TDN will search the PeerId in the network and establish a connection. At the same time, the user can also Fully customize the account model and connection verification method of the application.

# BendDAO Lending Protocol

This repository contains the smart contracts source code and markets configuration for BendDAO Lending Protocol. The repository uses Hardhat as development enviroment for compilation, testing and deployment tasks.

## What is BendDAO Lending Protocol?

BendDAO Lending Protocol is a decentralized non-custodial NFT lending protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized fashion, using NFTs as collateral.

## Documentation

The documentation of BendDAO Lending Protocol is in the following [BendDAO documentation](https://docs.benddao.xyz) link. At the documentation you can learn more about the protocol, see the contract interfaces, integration guides and audits.

For getting the latest contracts addresses, please check the [Deployed contracts](https://docs.benddao.xyz/developers/deployed-contracts) page at the documentation to stay up to date.

## Audits
1. [Verilog Solutions Online Report](https://hackmd.io/@verilog/benddao-audit).
2. [Certik Online Report](https://www.certik.com/projects/bend-dao).

## Thanks
BendDAO lending protocol refers to the architecture design and adopts some of the code of [AAVE](https://github.com/aave).
We are very grateful to AAVE for providing us with an excellent DeFi platform.

## Connect with the community

You can join at the [Discord](https://discord.gg/benddao) channel or at the [Governance](https://snapshot.org/#/benddao.eth) for asking questions about the protocol or talk about BendDAO with other peers.

## Getting Started

You can install `@benddao/bend-protocol` as an NPM package in your Hardhat, Buidler or Truffle project to import the contracts and interfaces:

`npm install @benddao/bend-protocol`

Import at Solidity files:

```
import {ILendPool} from ""@benddao/bend-protocol/contracts/interfaces/ILendPool.sol"";

contract Misc {

  function deposit(address pool, address token, address user, uint256 amount) public {
    ILendPool(pool).deposit(token, amount, user, 0);
    {...}
  }
}
```

The JSON artifacts with the ABI and Bytecode are also included into the bundled NPM package at `artifacts/` directory.

Import JSON file via Node JS `require`:

```
const LendPoolArtifact = require('@benddao/bend-protocol/artifacts/contracts/protocol/LendPool.sol/LendPool.json');

// Log the ABI into console
console.log(LendPoolArtifact.abi)
```

## Setup

The repository uses Docker Compose to manage sensitive keys and load the configuration. Prior any action like test or deploy, you must run `docker-compose up` to start the `contracts-env` container, and then connect to the container console via `docker-compose exec contracts-env bash`.

Follow the next steps to setup the repository:

- Install `docker` and `docker-compose`
- Create an enviroment file named `.env` and fill the next enviroment variables

```
# Mnemonic, only first address will be used
MNEMONIC=""""

# Add Alchemy or Infura provider keys, alchemy takes preference at the config level
ALCHEMY_KEY=""""
INFURA_KEY=""""

# Optional Etherscan key, for automatize the verification of the contracts at Etherscan
ETHERSCAN_KEY=""""

```

## Markets configuration

The configurations related with the BendDAO Markets are located at `markets` directory. You can follow the `IBendConfiguration` interface to create new Markets configuration or extend the current BendDAO configuration.

Each market should have his own Market configuration file, and their own set of deployment tasks, using the BendDAO market config and tasks as a reference.

## Test

You can run the full test suite with the following commands:

```
# In one terminal
docker-compose up

# Open another tab or terminal
docker-compose exec contracts-env bash

# install dependencies
yarn install

# A new Bash terminal is prompted, connected to the container
npm run test
```

## Deployments

For deploying BendDAO Lending Protocol, you can use the available scripts located at `package.json`. For a complete list, run `npm run` to see all the tasks.

### Prepare
```
# In one terminal
docker-compose up

# Open another tab or terminal
docker-compose exec contracts-env bash

# install dependencies
yarn install

# Runing NPM task
# npm run xxx
```

### Localhost dev deployment
```
# In first terminal
npm run hardhat:node

# In second terminal
npm run bend:localhost:dev:migration
```

### Localhost full deployment
```
# In first terminal
npm run hardhat:node

# In second terminal
npx hardhat --network localhost ""dev:deploy-mock-reserves""
# then update pool config reserve address

npx hardhat --network localhost ""dev:deploy-mock-nfts""
# then update pool config nft address

npx hardhat --network localhost ""dev:deploy-mock-aggregators"" --pool Bend
# then update pool config reserve aggregators address

npx hardhat --network localhost ""dev:deploy-mock-bnft-registry"" --pool Bend
# then update pool config bnft registry address

npx hardhat --network localhost ""dev:deploy-mock-bnft-tokens"" --pool Bend
```

### Rinkeby full deployment
```
# In one terminal
npm run bend:rinkeby:full:migration
```

## Interact with BendDAO Lending Protocol in Mainnet via console

You can interact with BendDAO Lending Protocol at Mainnet network using the Hardhat console, in the scenario where the frontend is down or you want to interact directly. You can check the deployed addresses at [deployed-contracts](https://docs.benddao.xyz/developers/deployed-contracts).

Run the Hardhat console pointing to the Mainnet network:

```
npx hardhat --network main console
```

At the Hardhat console, you can interact with the protocol:

```
// Load the HRE into helpers to access signers
run(""set-DRE"")

// Import getters to instance any Bend contract
const contractGetters = require('./helpers/contracts-getters');

// Load the first signer
const signer = await contractGetters.getFirstSigner();

// Lend pool instance
const lendPool = await contractGetters.getLendPool(""0x3AF6fC17EbD751E4D11F5A1d6823b2aE64723B87"");

// ERC20 token WETH Mainnet instance
const WETH = await contractGetters.getIErc20Detailed(""0xbe4d36E2C69Aa9658e937f6cC584E60167484381"");

// Approve 10 WETH to LendPool address
await WETH.connect(signer).approve(lendPool.address, ethers.utils.parseUnits('10'));

// Deposit 10 WETH
await lendPool.connect(signer).deposit(DAI.address, ethers.utils.parseUnits('10'), await signer.getAddress(), '0');
```

## Tools

This project integrates other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
node scripts/deploy.js
npx eslint '**/*.js'
npx eslint '**/*.js' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

## Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.template file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.js
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS ""Hello, Hardhat!""
```

## Quickstart

GUN is *super easy* to get started with:

 - Try the [interactive tutorial](https://gun.eco/docs/Todo-Dapp) in the browser (**5min** ~ average developer).
 - Or `npm install gun` and run the examples with `cd node_modules/gun && npm start` (**5min** ~ average developer).

> **Note:** If you don't have [node](http://nodejs.org/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), read [this](https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/examples/install.sh) first.
> If the `npm` command line didn't work, you may need to `mkdir node_modules` first or use `sudo`.

- An online demo of the examples are available here: http://gunjs.herokuapp.com/
- Or write a quick app: ([try now in a playground](https://jsbin.com/kadobamevo/edit?js,console))
```html
<script src=""https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gun/gun.js""></script>
<script>
// import GUN from 'gun'; // in ESM
// GUN = require('gun'); // in NodeJS
// GUN = require('gun/gun'); // in React
gun = GUN();

gun.get('mark').put({
  name: ""Mark"",
  email: ""mark@gun.eco"",
});

gun.get('mark').on((data, key) => {
  console.log(""realtime updates:"", data);
});

setInterval(() => { gun.get('mark').get('live').put(Math.random()) }, 9);
</script>
```
- Or try something **mind blowing**, like saving circular references to a table of documents! ([play](http://jsbin.com/wefozepume/edit?js,console))
```javascript
cat = {name: ""Fluffy"", species: ""kitty""};
mark = {boss: cat};
cat.slave = mark;

// partial updates merge with existing data!
gun.get('mark').put(mark);

// access the data as if it is a document.
gun.get('mark').get('boss').get('name').once(function(data, key){
  // `once` grabs the data once, no subscriptions.
  console.log(""Mark's boss is"", data);
});

// traverse a graph of circular references!
gun.get('mark').get('boss').get('slave').once(function(data, key){
  console.log(""Mark is the cat's slave!"", data);
});

// add both of them to a table!
gun.get('list').set(gun.get('mark').get('boss'));
gun.get('list').set(gun.get('mark'));

// grab each item once from the table, continuously:
gun.get('list').map().once(function(data, key){
  console.log(""Item:"", data);
});

// live update the table!
gun.get('list').set({type: ""cucumber"", goal: ""jumping cat""});
```

### History

[GUN](https://gun.eco) was created by [Mark Nadal](https://twitter.com/marknadal) in 2014 after he had spent 4 years trying to get his collaborative web app to scale up with traditional databases.

<img width=""250px"" src=""https://gun.eco/see/problem.png"" align=""left"" title=""pain point"" style=""margin: 0 1em 1em 0""> After he realized [Master-Slave database architecture causes one big bottleneck](https://gun.eco/distributed/matters.html), he (as a complete newbie outsider) naively decided **to question the status quo** and shake things up with controversial, heretical, and contrarian experiments:

**The NoDB** - no master, no servers, no ""single source of truth"", not built with a real programming language or real hardware, no DevOps, no locking, not *just* SQL or NoSQL but both (**all** - graphs, documents, tables, key/value).

The goal was to build a P2P database that could survive living inside **any** browser, and could correctly sync data between **any** device after assuming **any** offline-first activity.

<img src=""https://gun.eco/see/compare.png"" title=""comparison table"">

Technically, **GUN is a graph synchronization protocol** with a *lightweight embedded engine*, capable of doing *[20M+ API ops/sec](https://gun.eco/docs/Performance)* in **just ~9KB gzipped size**.

I am missing many others, apologies, will be adding them soon! This list is infintiely old & way out of date, if you want to be listed in it please make a PR! :)

## Testing

You will need to `npm install -g mocha` first. Then in the gun root folder run `npm test`. Tests will trigger persistent writes to the DB, so subsequent runs of the test will fail. You must clear the DB before running the tests again. This can be done by running `rm -rf *data*` command in the project directory.

## Shims

 > These are only needed for NodeJS & React Native, they shim the native Browser WebCrypto API.

If you want to use [SEA](https://gun.eco/docs/SEA) for `User` auth and security, you will need to install:

`npm install @peculiar/webcrypto --save`

Please see [our React Native docs](https://gun.eco/docs/React-Native) for installation instructions!

Then you can require [SEA](https://gun.eco/docs/SEA) without an error:

```javascript
GUN = require('gun/gun');
SEA = require('gun/sea');
```

## Deploy

 > Note: The default examples that get auto-deployed on `npm start` CDN-ify all GUN files, modules, & storage.
 
 > Note: Moving forward, AXE will start to automatically cluster your peer into a shared DHT. You may want to disable this to run an isolated network.
 
 > Note: When deploying a web application using GUN on a cloud provider, you may have to set `CI=false` in your `.env`. This prevents GUN-specific warnings from being treated as errors when deploying your app. You may also resolve this by modifying your webpack config to not try to build the GUN dependencies.

To quickly spin up a GUN relay peer for your development team, utilize [Heroku](http://heroku.com), [Docker](http://docker.com), or any others listed below. Or some variant thereof [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/), K8s, etc. ! Or use all of them so your relays are decentralized too!

### Linux

`SSH` into the home directory of a clean OS install with `sudo` ability. Set any environment variables you need (see below), then do:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amark/gun/master/examples/install.sh | bash
```

 > Read [install.sh](https://github.com/amark/gun/blob/master/examples/install.sh) first!
 > If `curl` is not found, *copy&paste* the contents of install.sh into your ssh.

You can now safely `CTRL+A+D` to escape without stopping the peer. To stop everything `killall screen` or `killall node`.

Environment variables may need to be set like `export HTTPS_CERT=~/cert.pem HTTPS_KEY=~/key.pem PORT=443`. You can also look at a sample [nginx](https://gun.eco/docs/nginx) config. For production deployments, you probably will want to use something like `pm2` or better to keep the peer alive after machine reboots.

### [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/amark/gun)

 > Heroku deletes your data every 15 minutes, one way to fix this is by adding [cheap storage](https://gun.eco/docs/Using-Amazon-S3-for-Storage).

Or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amark/gun.git
cd gun
heroku create
git push -f heroku HEAD:master
```

Then visit the URL in the output of the 'heroku create' step, in a browser. Make sure to set any environment config vars in the settings tab.

### [Zeet.co](https://www.zeet.co/)

[![Deploy](https://deploy.zeet.co/gun.svg)](https://deploy.zeet.co/?url=https://github.com/amark/gun)

Then visit the URL in the output of the 'now --npm' step, in your browser.

unixpickle/metaverse,Go,"# Metaverse

This project aims to learn to learn to play video games. That was not a typo: the aim here is meta-learning, or learning to learn. If this works, it would be a major step in the direction of [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence).

# Motivation

Most problems in real life can be translated into video games. If we had AI that could use intuition to solve new games quickly, that could go a *long* way towards strong AI.

If things go well, this will be a huge stage of my [meta-learning quest](https://blog.aqnichol.com/2017/04/15/the-meta-learning-quest-part-1/).

# Hypotheses

A feed-forward network without [sgdstore](https://github.com/unixpickle/sgdstore) will probably go a long way. It may be possible to train one network on at least half a dozen games simultaneously. Thus, it is important to gather baselines and ensure that sgdstore and other meta-learning approaches actually help.

I fear that there will be a great amount of overfitting. There are only ~100 games in Universe with reward signals. If I want more data, I may have to find a way to use the games without reward signals.

I also suspect that TRPO will fail for some of the games in Universe. It is possible that transfer learning will actually *help* learn those games, but I am not super optimistic.

To remedy the above problems, I will probably end up taking one of two approaches. One, I may collect demonstration data and use it to perform supervised meta-learning. Two, I may use a per-game critic to leverage actor-critic methods like GAE. However, I do not see myself using anything like A3C; it is unclear to me how well A3C works for long time dependencies.

# IOTABOTS Website

This is the repository for the IOTABOTS website on [www.iotabots.io](https://www.iotabots.io).

You can contribute to this code an earn badges and XP on our [soonaverse.com project](https://soonaverse.com/space/0x9dd831f7eed22ca73b254422baab74a8c460e438/awards).

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### React Component Library

We have a Library with all shared [IOTABOTS components](https://github.com/iotabots/nft-ui-components) - published on npmjs.com: [@iotabots/components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iotabots/components). This library contains several components to quickly and efficiently build new applications within the IOTABOTS design.

### Storybook

On top of Material UI's base ui components we have custom shared UI components for the iotabots team and community. These can be found in Storybook [Live Preview Page](https://iotabots.github.io/nft-ui-components/?path=/story/example-introduction--page)

### Getting Started

First, install the dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

after that, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

common-metaverse/urn-namespaces,,"# A common identifier for assets across the metaverse projects

Identifying a blockchain asset is difficult. Wallets, exchanges, tools and other pieces of software need to know the specifics about how to interact with the project's infrastructure to get images or to render content. This repository aims to resolve the content addressing mechanisms to embed our crypto-art, assets, wearables and avatars into different metaverse projects using a common identifier.

## URN

A Uniform Resource Name ([URNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name)) are globally unique persistent identifiers assigned within defined namespaces so they will be available for a long period of time, even after the resource which they identify ceases to exist or becomes unavailable.

# Registered namespaces

- `urn:cryptovoxels` - https://www.cryptovoxels.com - [Namespace documentation](namespaces/cryptovoxels.md)
- `urn:decentraland` - https://decentraland.org - [Namespace documentation](namespaces/decentraland.md)
- `urn:thesandboxgame` - https://www.sandbox.game - [Namespace documentation](namespaces/thesandboxgame.md)

# Adding a namespace

1. Fork this project
2. Set the name of your namespace (equals to the Github organization name)
3. Create a `namespaces/{your-namespace}.md` file
4. Add the file to README.md (ordered alphabetically)
5. Send a pull request. We will wait for someone in the organization (same as namespace) to come along and approve the pull request. To avoid ownership problems, only organizations with verified domains will be accepted, that way, we are delegating ownership validation to Github.

# Rationale

URN are composed of three main elements: Header (`urn:`), A namespace, and an NSS (namespace-specific string) forming a string in the shape `urn:{namespace}:{nss}`.  

The proposal only enforces that the namespace is part of a well-known list of namespaces with mappings to APIs or docummentation on how to resolve the NSS part of the asset.  

I.e, in Decentraland, they are using the format `urn:decentraland:{chain-identifier}:{contract}:{tokenid}` to identify every asset.  

Some examples of this implementation could be:

```yml
urn:cryptovoxels:ethereum:COLR:0x1
urn:decentraland:matic:0x000000000123123:0x332
urn:thesandboxgame:ethereum:LAND:0x1010
urn:decentraland:matic:quests:1
```

## Extensibility

After the namespace-specific string, a query string component is a valid part of any URN, making extensions not only possible but very easy to parse and implement. 

```yml
urn:decentraland:ethereum:LAND:0x1010?atBlock=1231411231
```

## Benefit

* Wallets and service providers like exchanges could start indexing assets unequivocally using a common ID.
* By documenting namespaces and its content resolution, tool developers would have a lower entry barrier fostering innovation of the ecosystem and the rise of the metaverse.
* Take an initial step to portability and interoperability of assets across the metaverse.
* URN are designed to last forever. Completely decoupled from absolute URLs and servers.

## Summarizing
- Identify assets using `urn:{metaverse-namespace}:{custom-string}`.  
- `{custom-string}` is a namespace-specific string, hierarchically separating the parts of the custom-string with colon `:` is recommended and friendlyer than `/` for URL encoding (`urn:decentraland:ethereum:LAND:0x1` instead of `urn:decentraland:ethereum/LAND/0x1`).

vircadia/project-apollo,C#,"# Project Apollo

## Goal
To create a opensource metaverse server for Project-Athena.
This metaverse server deals with ""domains"" and ""users"".
Other metaverse functions (inventory, chat, sound, assets, ...)
are handled by other servers.

## State of Implementation

This project is not yet complete and has many API calls missing. 
In this early stage, this metaverse server implementation is only
good for development.
Eventually, this project will allow people to create and run
their own personal portion of the Metaverse.

For building and running this code,
refer to [Notes On Development] for that information.

As of 20200824 (August 24, 2020), most of the new metaverse-server
development has moved to the [Iamus] project which is a
metaverse-server implemented in NodeJS/ExpressJS/MongoDB.

Uttam-Singhh/NFT-market,JavaScript,"# NFT-market
A Metaverse Marketplace in which a user puts an item for sale, the ownership of the item will be transferred from the creator to the marketplace. When a user purchases an item, the purchase price will be transferred from the buyer to the seller and the item will be transferred from the marketplace to the buyer.

The marketplace owner will be able to set a listing fee. This fee will be taken from the seller and transferred to the contract owner upon completion of any sale, enabling the owner of the marketplace to earn recurring revenue from any sale transacted in the marketplace.

Head over to our [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/jwHibRiX/561047a10c4c8b5e85d20bf12db833f5/the-metaverse-carnival-roadmap) for instructions on how the contribution progress works.

Justin has posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/JustinPBarnett) about the project, so check that out for some more info about the process and end goals.

### Steps to contribute
1) [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely (more detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork)).
2) Create a branch for your edits (for example, ""contributors/JustinPBarnett/player-controller-bug"").
3) Create a PR early. Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Issue...” or ""Trello task..."") and include a link.
4) Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include visual differences. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
5) Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
6) Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.

If you feel like tackling some [bugs](https://trello.com/v/04j3I4EO/bugs), we would love you forever!

#### A list of Metaverse aggregation for beginners. 

## Definition of Metaverse
Metaverse is a fully immersive internet, where we will be able to access augmented and virtual reality and interact with all sorts of environments using persistent avatars and innovative digital technology.<br> 

## History of the Metaverse[^1]
1956 - Morton Heilig created the first VR machine, the Sensorama Machine. <br>
1978 - MIT created the Aspen Movie Map. <br>
1982 - Neil Stevenson used ""metaverse"" to describe virtual places in his novel ""Snow Crash"". <br>
1994 - Sega VR was the first commercial VR headset released publicly in Japan. <br>
1998 - Sportsvision broadcast the first live NFL game with a yellow yard marker, and the idea of overlaying graphics over real-world views.<br>
2010 - Palmer Luckey created the prototype for the Oculus Rift VR headset. <br>
2011 - The Book Ready Player One described a complete virtual world that we could immersively enter and escape from reality. <br>
2014 - Facebook acquired Oculus VR, Sony and Samsung both announced that they were inventing their own VR   headsets, Google released Cardboard and AR Glasses. <br>
2016 - Microsoft released HoloLens headsets which allowed users to experience both AR and VR reality. <br>
2020 - NFT became a hit topic in the world. <br>
2021 - Facebook rebranded to Meta on sharpening it's vision toward Metaverse. <br>
2022 - MHTTP is creating truly open protocols for virtual world teleportation.

## Glossary
#### [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3)
Web3 is an idea for a new iteration of the World Wide Web which revolves around concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics. and takes advantage of various decentralizing technologies including (but not limited to) blockchain technology. <br>

#### [DeFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance)
Decentralized finance (DeFi) offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks by using smart contracts on a blockchain. <br>

#### [DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/decentralized-automated-organizations-daos-guide-for-beginners/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work)
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain.

#### [NFT](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211)
Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other.

#### [WebXR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API)
WebVR API was first conceived in spring 2014 by Vladimir Vukićević from Mozilla. WebXR is a group of standards which are used together to support rendering 3D scenes to hardware designed for presenting virtual worlds, or for adding graphical imagery to the real world, (augmented reality, or AR).

#### SocialXR
Social XR allows people to experience social presence and engage in real-time conversations and activities with each other through the use of XR technologies. 

#### Metaverse Teleportation
In the Metaverse, ensuring user rights to teleportation is fundamental to breaking down walled gardens and safeguarding an open and connected ecosystem.<br>

## Protocols and Standards
[MHTTP](https://github.com/mhttp-org/portal-js) - enables developers to create portals using an open JSON schema, and empowers users to teleport through these portals to destinations.<br>
[Open Metaverse Interoperability](https://github.com/omigroup/omigroup) - bridges virtual worlds by designing and promoting protocols for identity, social graphs, inventory, and more.<br>
[Dat](https://dat-ecosystem.org/) - peer-to-peer protocol <br>
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io) - peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol<br>
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/learn/) - Decentralized world computer<br>
[WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/) - accesses VR/AR hardware on the web <br>

# React.js Pixel Streaming for Unreal Engine

[**MetaEditor**](http://metaeditor.io/), created by the team at [UnrealOS](https://unrealos.com/) is a professional web application development solution based on ReactJS and PixelStreaming.

The Open Source MetaEditor offers a complete set of tools for professional developing and running the Unreal Engine’s Applications in browsers.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://metaeditor.io/assets/video.gif?v=2"" width=""100%"" title=""Pixel Streaming"">
</p>

The standard implementation of the PixelStreaming significantly complicates developing your own reactive web applications for the Unreal Engine. Initially, the PixelStreaming was a no-architecture javascript solution for interacting, which has reactive web frameworks. Adapting the standard ReactJS for the PixelStreaming is a very long and laborious process, which significantly increases development time, because there are many technical problems to solve. It is related to the peculiarities of browsers, devices, and reactive technologies (like the ReactJS)

The [MetaEditor.io](https://metaeditor.io/) helps to integrate the Unreal Engine v.5 into the browser. It allows you to send commands and get callbacks from the stream server with the Unreal Engine launched.

## 🧬 Introduction

`Presencejs` is a JavaScript library that allows you to build real-time web applications quickly. The server is built on top of [YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo), which will provide secure, low-latency, and high-performance geo-distributed services.

- **WebTransport** [Introduction: WebTransport is an API offering low-latency, bidirectional, client-server messaging.](https://web.dev/webtransport/)
  - Fallback to WebSocket if WebTransport connection cannot be established
- **Secure**, **low-latency** and **high-performance**
- Support **unreliable** and **reliable** data transmitting
- **Real-time** experience
- Auto Reconnection
- Built-in error retry
- TypeScript

...and a lot more.

With `presencejs`, components will get data flow in real time. Thus, the UI will be always **fast** and **reactive**.

## 🥷🏼 Quick Start

### 1. Add `presencejs` to your web app

Using npm

```
$ npm i --save @yomo/presencejs
```

Using yarn

```
$ yarn add @yomo/presencejs
```

Using pnpm

```
$ pnpm i @yomo/presencejs
```

For CDN, you can use [skypack](https://www.skypack.dev): [https://cdn.skypack.dev/@yomo/presencejs](https://cdn.skypack.dev/@yomo/presencejs)

```html
<script type=""module"">
    import Presence from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@yomo/presencejs';
</script>
```

### 2. Connect to presence server

The client need to authenticate with YoMo to establish a realtime connection. The following code sample uses a demo YoMo's server(`https://prsc.yomo.dev`) and `token` to authenticate and print the message `Connected to YoMo!` when you’ve successfully connected.

#### How do I get a token?

First, login with your Github account on [presencejs.yomo.run](https://presencejs.yomo.run), get a free `app_id` and `app_secret`.

If you build your application using Next.js, then you can use [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) to get the access token.
For example, the following API route `pages/api/presence-auth.js` returns a json response with a status code of 200:

```js
export default async function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === 'GET') {
        try {
            const response = await fetch('https://prsc.yomo.dev/api/v1/auth', {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    app_id: process.env.PRESENCE_APP_ID,
                    app_secret: process.env.PRESENCE_APP_SECRET,
                }),
            });
            const data = await response.json();
            const token = data.data;
            if (token) {
                res.status(200).json(token);
            } else {
                res.status(400).json({ msg: data.message });
            }
        } catch (error) {
            if (typeof error === 'string') {
                res.status(500).json({ msg: error });
            } else if (error instanceof Error) {
                res.status(500).json({ msg: error.message });
            }
        }
    } else {
        // Handle any other HTTP method
        res.status(405).json({})
    }
}
```

Response data:

```json
{
    ""token"": ""eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...""
}
```

#### Create a `Presence` instance

```js
import Presence from '@yomo/presencejs';

// create an instance.
const yomo = new Presence('https://prsc.yomo.dev', {
    auth: {
        // Certification Type
        type: 'token',
        // Api for getting access token
        endpoint: '/api/presence-auth',
    },
});

yomo.on('connected', () => {
    console.log('Connected to server: ', yomo.host);
});
```

### 3. Subscribe to messages from the server

Call the `toRoom('001')` function to enter room `001`, without it, you are in the default room.The client receives a message with the name `online` through the `on` callback function, and can also subscribe to a message with the name `mousemove` by returning an observable object through `on$`.

```js
yomo.on('connected', () => {
    // Enter a room
    yomo.toRoom('001');

    // Function to handle response for given event from server
    yomo.on('online', data => {
        console.log('online:', data);
    });

    // Same as the `on` method, returns an observable response
    yomo.on$('mousemove').subscribe(data => {
        console.log('mousemove:', data);
    });

    // If you want to display the latency, you can get the value of the latency like this
    yomo.on('latency', data => {
        const { id, latency, meshId } = data;
        console.log('latency:', latency);
    });
});
```

### 4. Send messages to the server

The following example code send a message to the quickstart room with the name `online` and the contents pixel position.
You can use rxjs to get an observable sequence of browser event transitions，then send the data to the signal channel with the name `mousemove` in room `001` via `ofRoom('001', 'mousemove')`.

```js
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

const ID = '34a1dbb5-c031-4680-926c-84a789d251e0';

yomo.on('connected', () => {
    // Function for sending data to the server
    yomo.send('online', {
        id: ID,
        x: 10,
        y: 10,
    });

    // Converting browser events into observable sequences.
    const mousemove$ = fromEvent(document, 'mousemove').pipe(
        map(event => {
            return {
                id: ID,
                x: event.clientX,
                y: event.clientY,
            };
        })
    );

    // Sending data streams to the server
    mousemove$.subscribe(yomo.ofRoom('001', 'mousemove'));
});
```

### 5. Close a connection

A connection to YoMo can be closed once it is no longer needed.

```js
yomo.close();
yomo.on('closed', () => {
    console.log('Closed the connection');
});
```

# React.js Pixel Streaming for Unreal Engine

[**MetaEditor**](http://metaeditor.io/), created by the team at [UnrealOS](https://unrealos.com/) is a professional web application development solution based on ReactJS and PixelStreaming.

The Open Source MetaEditor offers a complete set of tools for professional developing and running the Unreal Engine’s Applications in browsers.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""https://metaeditor.io/assets/video.gif?v=2"" width=""100%"" title=""Pixel Streaming"">
</p>

The standard implementation of the PixelStreaming significantly complicates developing your own reactive web applications for the Unreal Engine. Initially, the PixelStreaming was a no-architecture javascript solution for interacting, which has reactive web frameworks. Adapting the standard ReactJS for the PixelStreaming is a very long and laborious process, which significantly increases development time, because there are many technical problems to solve. It is related to the peculiarities of browsers, devices, and reactive technologies (like the ReactJS)

The [MetaEditor.io](https://metaeditor.io/) helps to integrate the Unreal Engine v.5 into the browser. It allows you to send commands and get callbacks from the stream server with the Unreal Engine launched.

Convex-Dev/convex,Java,"# Convex

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/world.convex/convex.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/search?q=world.convex)

Convex is a decentralised network and execution engine for the Internet of Value. It can be seen as an implementation of a ""Stateful Internet"" where the network itself securely hosts and executes code and data.

It is designed as a full stack solution for decentralised application and economic systems that manage digital assets, where asset ownership is cryptographically secured and can be managed (optionally) with Smart Contracts. It has some similarities with a typical public blockchain, but offers some significant advantages:

- Global State model with immutable data structures and atomic transactions
- Lambda Calculus based VM supporting Turing complete Smart Contracts
- High transaction throughput (tens of thousands of write transactions per second, scaling to millions in the future)
- Low latency for transaction confirmation (milliseconds for global consensus, depending on network speed)
- 100% Green - energy efficiency using the the Convergent Proof of Stake consensus algorithm
- Integrated on-chain compiler (Convex Lisp)

## About this repository

This repository contains the core Convex distribution including:

- The Convex Virtual Machine (CVM) including data structures and execution environment
- The standard Convex Peer server implementation (NIO based) implementing Convergent Proof of Stake (CPoS) for consensus
- CLI Tools for operating Peers, scripting transactions and more
- The Etch database for persistent data storage
- A Swing GUI for managing local peers / exploring the network
- JMH Benchmarking suite
- Java Client API

The repository also contains core ""on-chain"" libraries providing key full-stack functionality and tools for decentralised applications, including:

- `convex.fungible` - Fungible Tokens
- `asset.nft.simple` - Basic lightweight Non-fungible tokens
- `asset.nft.tokens` - More advanced NFTs with customisable functionality
- `convex.asset` - library for managing arbitrary digital assets using a common abstraction
- `convex.trust` - library for access control and trusted operations
- `torus.exchange` - decentralised exchange for trading fungible tokens and currencies
- Example code and templates for various forms of smart contracts

For making use of Convex data structures, CVM execution etc. locally you probably just need `convex-core`. If you want to run a Peer or talk to a Peer over the network, then you will need `convex-peer` as a dependency. The other modules are mainly intended to run as standalone applications.

## Key features

* *Virtual Machine* - The Convex Virtual Machine provides a secure execution environment based on the Lambda Calculus and capable of acting as the execution layer for smart contracts and autonomous agents.
* *Decentralised Consensus* - Similar to Blockchain technology, Convex incorporates a consensus mechanism that ensures all nodes ultimately agree on true values in the system without the control of any single entity. This property means that it is inherently tamper-proof and censorship-resistant.
* *Performance and Scalability* - Convex is capable of executing large volumes of transactions (tens of thousands of transactions per second) with low latency (sub-second global consensus)
* *100% Green* - No wasteful consumption of energy or computing resources

## Running Convex

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

For more information about running a Convex Peer and the Command Line Interface see the [documentation](https://convex-dev.github.io/convex/convex-cli/)

### Local GUI Peers

The convex Peer Manager (GUI application) can be used to run a local test network.

This can be invoked by running the jar archive directly e.g. with the following command:

`java -jar convex-gui/target/convex-gui-0.7.1.jar`

or you can run this from the command line by using the `local gui` command:

```
./convex local gui
```

## Key Features

Implement models, such as BERT, Reformer, and T5, that outperform classical language models<br>
Compare NLP applications using GPT-3, GPT-2, and other transformers<br>
Analyze advanced use cases, including polysemy, cross-lingual learning, and computer vision<br>

## Book Description
Transformers are a game-changer for natural language understanding (NLU) and have become one of the pillars of artificial intelligence.<br>

Transformers for Natural Language Processing, 2nd Edition, investigates deep learning for machine translations, speech-to-text, text-to-speech, language modeling, question-answering, and many more NLP domains with transformers.<br>

An Industry 4.0 AI specialist needs to be adaptable; knowing just one NLP platform is not enough anymore. Different platforms have different benefits depending on the application, whether it's cost, flexibility, ease of implementation, results, or performance. In this book, we analyze numerous use cases with Hugging Face, Google Trax, OpenAI, and AllenNLP.<br>

This book takes transformers' capabilities further by combining multiple NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling, to analyze complex use cases, such as dissecting fake news on Twitter. Also, see how transformers can create code using just a brief description.<br>

By the end of this NLP book, you will understand transformers from a cognitive science perspective and be proficient in applying pretrained transformer models to various datasets.<br>

## What you will learn
Discover new ways of performing NLP techniques with the latest pretrained transformers<br>
Grasp the workings of the original Transformer, GPT-3, BERT, T5, DeBERTa, and Reformer<br>
Create language understanding Python programs using concepts that outperform classical deep learning models<br>
Apply Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch programs to sentiment analysis, text summarization, speech recognition, machine translations, and more<br>
Measure the productivity of key transformers to define their scope, potential, and limits in production<br>
## Who This Book Is For
If you want to learn about and apply transformers to your natural language (and image) data, this book is for you.<br>

A good understanding of NLP, Python, and deep learning is required to benefit most from this book. Many platforms covered in this book provide interactive user interfaces, which allow readers with a general interest in NLP and AI to follow several chapters of this book.<br>

```

## Quickstart

If you just plan to read from the blockchain, you do not need any ETP and you do not need to set your `MVS_PRIVATE_KEY`. If you plan to deploy contracts or write anything to the blockchain, you'll need ETP and you'll need to set your `MVS_PRIVATE_KEY` for the account that has those tokens.

### Network selection (Optional)
#### a) Connect to a local node (default)

This option is the default. It will try to connect to a local node on http://localhost:9933 which is the default of a locally running fullnode. 
#### b) Use Hyperspace mainnet explorer RPC

Set the environment variable

```sh
# To use the mainnet
export MVS_NETWORK=hyperspace
# OR
export MVS_RPC_URL=https://vm.mvs.org/mainnet_rpc/
```

Or add the parameter --network hyperspace to your mvs-vm-cli command

#### c) Use Hyperspace testnet explorer RPC

```sh
# To use the mainnet
export MVS_NETWORK=testnet
# OR
export MVS_RPC_URL=https://vm.mvs.org/testnet_rpc/
```

#### d) Define custom url

```sh
export MVS_RPC_URL=http://IP_ADDRESS:PORT
```

### Set Private Key Environment (optional)

Required if you plan to deploy contracts or sign transactions.

```sh
# set environment variable 
export MVS_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

### 

### Check balance

```sh
mvs-vm-cli balance
```

### Transfer ETP

```sh
mvs-vm-cli transfer 0.1 to 0x67683dd2a499E765BCBE0035439345f48996892f
```

# Install 
***

## install Docker
> curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh

### Docker basic commands
In general, docker need root privilege, you can alias it  
> alias docker='sudo docker'

> docker help  
> docker version  
> docker images  
> docker ps  
> docker build  
> docker cp  
> docker run  
> docker stop / start / restart  
> docker exec

# build metaverse docker image
***

## clone mvs-docker.git

> git clone https://github.com/metaverse/mvs-docker.git

> cd mvs-docker

## binary version

**Binary version needs no building, just pull it down and use it directly. It has smaller image size than build from source, and can save a lot of time of compiling.**

> \# just pull it down, you can use this image directly  
> docker pull jowenshaw/metaverse

> \# if you feel the image name is hard to remember, you can tag it a new name  
> docker tag jowenshaw/metaverse metaverse

One thing to mention, the above image **`jowenshaw/metaverse`** is easily to use, it has setted the default configuration, including the following
> VOLUME [~/.metaverse]  
> EXPOSE 5251 8820 8821  
> ENTRYPOINT [""run_mvsd.sh""]

**Another way, you can build by the `Dockerfile` in directory `mvs_binary`**
> cd mvs_binary  
> \# copy mvsd and mvs-cli to bin directory  
> docker build -t metaverse -f Dockerfile .

actually, the `jowenshaw/metaverse` is built through the above way.

## build version

**Build from source is slowly but is more elastic, you can choose which version of source code to build.**

> \# clone / wget source code at local, and copy them to docker image.  
> \# This saves time to download source codes.  
> \# And, this way you can change the sources at locally, and build it in the image.  
> \# If you do not provide source codes here, the container will run get_source_codes.sh to get them.  
> \# So get source codes here is not a must step.  
> \# The only difference is the speed of downloading source codes.  

> ./mvs_build/get_source_codes.sh

> docker build -t metaverse -f Dockerfile .


# Dockerfile content
***

## binary version

**binary image is now directly usable, just pull it down, and use it directly.**

If you want to build from the binary with Dockerfile in `mvs_binary`, the following is the content.

**File Content**
```file
FROM ubuntu:16.04

# copy mvsd mvs-cli mvs.conf and auxiliary scripts
COPY ./bin /usr/local/bin

VOLUME [~/.metaverse]

# 5251 : P2P Network
# 8820 : JSON-RPC CALL
# 8821 : Websocket notifcations
EXPOSE 5251 8820 8821

ENTRYPOINT [""run_mvsd.sh""]
```

## build version

**File Content**
```file
FROM ubuntu:16.04

# copy source codes and scripts and other auxiliary tools, all in mvs_build dir
COPY ./mvs_build /opt/mvs_build

# run build_metaverse_image.sh, the first param is the apt sources.list file
# which will replace /etc/apt/sources.list with /opt/mvs_build/$1 in the image.
# if the first param is empty, then use official sources which maybe slower.
RUN cd /opt/mvs_build && /bin/bash build_metaverse_image.sh aliyun_sources.list

VOLUME [~/.metaverse]

# 5251 : P2P Network
# 8820 : JSON-RPC CALL
# 8821 : Websocket notifcations
EXPOSE 5251 8820 8821

# run_mvsd.sh will call setup_mvs_conf.sh, then run mvsd.
# this way can ensure the config is always updated when create a new container.
ENTRYPOINT [""run_mvsd.sh""]
```


# Usage
***

## Start docker container
```bash
# run mvsd
docker run -p 8820:8820 metaverse
or,
# specify the container name,
docker run --name=metaverse -p 8820:8820 metaverse
or,
# run in the background,
docker run -d --name=metaverse -p 8820:8820 metaverse
```

```bash
# run mvsd with more parameters
docker run --name=metaverse --privileged \
    -v /opt/ChainData/Metaverse/Mainnet:/root/.metaverse \
    -p 5251:5251 -p 8820:8820 -p 8821:8821 metaverse

# run mvsd testnet with different port number
docker run --name=metaverse-testnet --privileged \
    -v /opt/ChainData/Metaverse/Testnet:/root/.metaverse \
    -p 15251:5251 -p 18820:8820 -p 18821:8821 metaverse -t 10.10.10.123
```

> `--name=metaverse` will specify the container a name, you can use the name instead of container id or a hard to remember generated name.

> `-v /opt/ChainData/Metaverse/Mainnet:/root/.metaverse` will mount the container path /root/.metaverse to host path /opt/ChainData/Metaverse/Mainnet, now you can look the data in the host directly.

> `-p 5251:5251 -p 8820:8820 -p 8821:8821` bind ports, you can use `docker port metaverse` to see the port bindings.

> and you can use `docker inspect metaverse` to see more information, include the above infos.

> `-t` if specified, then run the testnet.

> ip address (eg. `10.10.10.123`) if specified, then this ip address can be specified to the config item `network.self`

## Test
```bash
# use curl to call APIs
curl -X POST --data '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""getinfo"",""params"":[],""id"":25}' http://127.0.0.1:8820/rpc/v3
```

## Execute mvs-cli commands
Run `mvs-cli` commands via `docker exec` command. Example:
```bash
# a0d2fb92dff8 here is the container id created from image `metaverse`
# you can `docker ps` to get it, and replace it with your container id.
docker exec a0d2fb92dff8 mvs-cli getinfo

# this id/name is hard to remember, you can rename it
docker rename a0d2fb92dff8 metaverse

# now, you can use the new name instead of container id or old name
docker exec metaverse mvs-cli getinfo
```

## Modify the config file manually
Sometimes you want to modify the metaverse config file manually after the container is started.
(for example, modify the network.self config item),
you can copy out the original config file, edit it, and copy it back to the container.
(use metaverse as the container id/name in this example)
```bash
# copy out the original config file
docker exec metaverse cp /root/.metaverse/mvs.conf ./

# after edit, copy it back to the container
docker exec metaverse cp ./mvs.conf /root/.metaverse/mvs.conf

# restart the container to make the modification effective
docker restart metaverse
```

## FAQ

### 在哪儿讨论？
[github issue](https://github.com/wwj718/Dynaverse/issues)


### 目前的项目状态是怎样的？

还处在准备阶段，我目前致力于梳理出相关资料，感兴趣的同伴可以据此起步。

希望围绕 Alan Kay、Smith... 过去的工作，形成一个有深度的讨论社区。 Alan Kay 将他的大部分工作成果，都归源于当时他所处的那个讨论团体。


### 你目前在做什么？

我目前在写一篇文章《Dynaverse: A Metaverse for Children of All Ages》, 向 Alan Kay 在 1972 年写的 [A Computer for Children of All Ages](https://www.mprove.de/visionreality/media/Kay72a.pdf) 致敬。

首先，致力于勾勒出愿景，描述在这个想象的世界中，人们如何生活、学习、娱乐、工作、创造...

之后，讨论为了实现以上场景，需要设计怎样的体系架构。 论述为何当前的技术是足以实现它的，为何现在是合适的时机。

最后，做出成本预估。


### 如何入门Smalltalk
一些推荐资料:

*  [Smalltalk Overview](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/musings/SmalltalkOverview.html): 最适合有过主流编程语言经验的人
*  [Smalltalk 入门导览](https://wwj718.github.io/post/%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B/smalltalk-guide/)
*  [TheCuisBook](https://cuis-smalltalk.github.io/TheCuisBook/)
   *  [中文版](https://github.com/lounsen/TheChineseCuisBook)

### 如何阅读 Croquet 源码

建议以建构主义式的学习方法(Smalltalk的设计深受其影响)

去跟对象(Objects)玩耍，把它们看作你房间里的玩具，推一推它，堆在一起试试...

目前的文档不多([Croquet Programming 1.0B](https://wwj718.github.io/post/img/Croquet%20Programming%201.0B.pdf)几乎是仅有的)，可以通过测试(tests)代码去理解对象。

### 技术选型

暂定:

*  WebXR
*  WebGPU
*  Lively

# if the first param is empty, then use official sources which maybe slower.
RUN cd /opt/mvs_build && /bin/bash build_metaverse_image.sh aliyun_sources.list

VOLUME [~/.metaverse]

```


# Usage
***

## Start docker container
```bash
# run mvsd
docker run -p 8820:8820 metaverse
or,
# specify the container name,
docker run --name=metaverse -p 8820:8820 metaverse
or,
# run in the background,
docker run -d --name=metaverse -p 8820:8820 metaverse
```

```bash
# run mvsd with more parameters
docker run --name=metaverse --privileged \

curl -X POST --data '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""getinfo"",""params"":[],""id"":25}' http://127.0.0.1:8820/rpc/v3
```

## Execute mvs-cli commands
Run `mvs-cli` commands via `docker exec` command. Example:
```bash
# a0d2fb92dff8 here is the container id created from image `metaverse`
# you can `docker ps` to get it, and replace it with your container id.
docker exec a0d2fb92dff8 mvs-cli getinfo

# this id/name is hard to remember, you can rename it
docker rename a0d2fb92dff8 metaverse

# now, you can use the new name instead of container id or old name
docker exec metaverse mvs-cli getinfo
```

## Modify the config file manually
Sometimes you want to modify the metaverse config file manually after the container is started.
(for example, modify the network.self config item),
you can copy out the original config file, edit it, and copy it back to the container.
(use metaverse as the container id/name in this example)
```bash
# copy out the original config file
docker exec metaverse cp /root/.metaverse/mvs.conf ./

# after edit, copy it back to the container
docker exec metaverse cp ./mvs.conf /root/.metaverse/mvs.conf

# restart the container to make the modification effective
docker restart metaverse

## XRE XRModule

### [Library of XRModules](https://github.com/XRFoundation?q=xre-project)

Create composable plug-ins for XREngine scenes with XRModule Projects

### [Create XRModule Projects](https://xrfoundation.github.io/ethereal-engine-docs/docs/concepts/projects_api)

XRModules are folders that contain all your custom code, assets and scenes. They are version controlled using git & github, and can be installed to any deployment with a single click. (more on that in the next chapter)

Pictured below is an example of 4 projects installed. By default, only the default-project is installed, which in a production environment is read only. You can find the default project under /packages/projects/default-project/

In a production environment, the builder process will install all projects according to the project database table and will download files from the storage provider. In a local development environment, the local file system is always the source of truth. Any project folders added or removed from the file system will be automatically added or removed from the database. This is to ensure there is no accidental loss of data, as these project folders are all git repositories.

## Launch XREngine with Control Center Install - ***RECOMMENDED***

### [Use Metaverse Control Plane Managment GUI](https://github.com/XRFoundation/XREngine-Control-Center)

Best for simple self hosting, advanced editor content creation, and XRE Pack Project development.

## Advanced Development Install

### Pre-Requisites

To install Ethereal Engine locally, the following pre-reqs are required.

* Linux (many of us develop on Ubuntu), Mac OS X, or Windows (we recommend WSL2)
* Node.js v16 or later (we recommend installing via [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  or [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).)
* C++ (for `node-gyp`), Python >=3.6 + [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), `make`
  and other build tools, for compiling Mediasoup.
  Although most of XREngine is written in TypeScript, it uses a [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/)
  engine for WebRTC conferencing. See the [Mediasoup install instructions](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/installation/)
  for more details.
* Docker. (Although Docker is technically optional, running XREngine requires starting up
  half a dozen different services, and using Docker Compose will make your life dramatically
  easier.)
* MariaDB and Redis. (If you're using Docker, containers for MariaDB and Redis 
  will automatically be started up.)

### Getting Started

See the [Installation instructions](https://xrfoundation.github.io/ethereal-engine-docs/docs/installation/)

### Let's build it together

We believe that projects like this are extremely complex and difficult, and can 
only be built when large groups of people work together, out in the open. If you 
believe that your calling is to build a free, open network that everyone, 
everywhere can get value from, then you are welcome in our community, and we'll 
do our best to get you set up.

We are always hiring talented people who want to be leaders in what is to come. 
Inquire with anyone who seems like they know what's going on and they'll help 
you find who you need to talk to.

sibozhang/Text2Video,Python,"# Text2Video
This is code for ICASSP 2022: ""Text2Video: Text-driven Talking-head Video Synthesis with Phonetic Dictionary"".
[Project Page](https://sites.google.com/view/sibozhang/text2video) 

## Introduction
With the advance of deep learning technology, automatic video generation from audio or text has become an emerging and promising research topic. In this paper, we present a novel approach to synthesize video from text. The method builds a phoneme-pose dictionary and trains a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate video from interpolated phoneme poses. Compared to audio-driven video generation algorithms, our approach has a number of advantages: 1) It only needs a fraction of the training data used by an audio-driven approach; 2) It is more ﬂexible and not subject to vulnerability due to speaker variation; 3) It signiﬁcantly reduces the preprocessing, training and inference time. We perform extensive experiments to compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art talking face generation methods on a benchmark dataset and datasets of our own. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.

## Data / Preprocessing

## Set up
1. Git clone repo
```
git clone git@github.com:sibozhang/Text2Video.git
```
2. Download and install modified vid2vid repo [vid2vid](https://github.com/sibozhang/vid2vid) 
3. Prepare data and folder in the following order

    ```

    ├── model
    ├── ...
    vid2vid
    ├── ...
    venv
    ├── vid2vid
    ```
4. Setup env 
```
sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3
pip install zhon
pip install moviepy
pip install ffmpeg
pip install dominate
pip install pydub
```

MTG/metaverse1-soundscape-rendering,SuperCollider,"# Metaverse1 soundscape rendering system

[Metaverse1](http://www.metaverse1.org/) was a three year ITEA2 research project, carried out between 2008 and 2011. The project goal was the creation of standards for the interaction between virtual worlds and the real world and the project culminated in the creation of the MPEG-V standard.

This repository contains code and documentation for the soundscape rendering application developed at the [Music Technology Group](http://mtg.upf.edu) for a virtual tourism use case within the Metaverse1 project. The soundscape rendering application was developed in SuperCollider, and the audio streaming server was programmed in Twisted/Python.

The system is a soundscape composition and rendering environment based on a generative graph based model of sound concepts. The code is provided mostly for archival and documentation purposes, in case it is interesting and useful for someone.

Documentation is scarce; if you have any questions or suggestions, please submit an issue in our issue tracker!

## Documentation

General project documentation, a demo video and a list of related publications can be found [on the MTG website](http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/soundscapes). Additionally, there is some developer and user documentation in the [doc](/doc) directory.

Here's a short repository overview:

# Gestaltor in the Metaverse
[Gestaltor](https://gestaltor.io/) is the first visual [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) editor to directly modify `.gltf` and `.glb` files. One of the [main features](https://ux3d.io/gestaltor) of this 3D editor and stager is, that a glTF is loaded and saved. This means, that any information and configuration inside the glTF during editing is preserved.  
  
glTF is the 3D format of choice for [non-fungible tokens (NFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token), in the [Metaverse](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/value-creation-in-the-metaverse) and [3D Commerce](https://www.khronos.org/3dcommerce/). glTF 2.0 became an [ISO standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/83990.html) in July 2022.
  
Following assets do help to create content using Gestaltor for the following metaverse platforms.

## General

Like in the real world, meters are also used as units in virtual space and the metaverse.  
Following ruler does have a size of 0.1 x 2.0 x 0.1 meters, which does easily allow size comparisson and adjustments.  
In this scene, an avatar from [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/) and a chair from [wayfair](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-blog/welcome-to-wayfairs-realtime-3d-model-api) are compared:  

![](Ruler_in_Gestaltor.jpg)

* Download [Ruler_2m.glb](General/Ruler_2m.glb)  

In some cases, one does want to add a basic shadow to the scene. This is possible with a simple fake shadow.  
In this scene, the [Boom Box](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/BoomBox) and a cupboard from [wayfair](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-blog/welcome-to-wayfairs-realtime-3d-model-api) are used. The shadow asset is arranged in such a way, that the Boom Box looks like it is positioned on the cupboard (screenshot taken from Gestaltor):  

![](Shadow_screenshot.jpg)

* Download [Shadow.glb](General/Shadow.glb)  

Sometimes, one does need a [Color Checker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorChecker). Here we go:  

![](ColorChecker.jpg)

* Download [ColorChecker.glb](General/ColorChecker.glb)  

## AltspaceVR
In [AltspaceVR](https://altvr.com/) one can upload and use glb assets. All polygons in the scene should [not exceed](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/altspace-vr/world-building/importing-models) the 100000 limit.  

The world units are in meters, so any provided glTF assets in meters can be used.

AltspaceVR is using in many cases only materials without textures. The following glTF contains several dielectric, rough materials based on this [color table](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html).

![](AltspaceVR_in_Gestaltor.jpg)

* Download [Colors.glb](AltspaceVR/Colors.glb)  

## Decentraland
In [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) it is possible to add own 3D models using glTF.  

### LAND
3D models can be placed on a [LAND](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#what-is-land) estate. A LAND estate does have a dimension of [16m x 16m](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/faq/#how-large-is-a-tile-of-land).  
The following asset does have a dimension of 16m x 16m in glTF plus a checkerboard texture of 1m x 1m:

![](LAND_in_Gestaltor.jpg)

* Download [1x1LAND.glb](Decentraland/1x1LAND.glb)  

## Hubs
Using [spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke) it is possible to upload and download 3D models to [Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) using glTF.  
In spoke and Hubs, the virtual space is segmented in several 10m x 10m areas.

![](Hubs_in_Gestaltor.jpg)

* Download [10x10m_Area.glb](Hubs/10x10m_Area.glb)  

## Oculus Home
In [Oculus Home](https://creator.oculus.com/blog/introducing-oculus-home-user-created-spaces/) the navigation area is a 250m cube and the visible area a 1000m cube.  
This asset includes a 250m x 250m floor plus visual hints for the navigation and visible area:

* Download [OculusHome.glb](OculusHome/OculusHome.glb)  

## Somnium Space
In [Somnium Space](https://somniumspace.com/) it is possible to upload and download 3D models using glTF.  

### Parcels
3D models can be placed on a Parcel. A Parcel can be of size [S, M and XL](https://somniumspace.medium.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-buying-land-parcel-in-somnium-space-4f66d18c1a73).  
The following assets are the basement of each Parcel:

* Download [ParcelM.glb](SomniumSpace/ParcelM.glb)  
* Download [ParcelXL.glb](SomniumSpace/ParcelXL.glb)  

## Spatial
In [Spatial](https://spatial.io/) it is possible to upload both `.glTF` and `.glb` 3D assets.  
However, they are using a different scaling system and it seems that 2m in other worlds is 1m in their world.

## Substrata
In [Substrata](https://substrata.info/) it is possible to upload 3D models using glTF.  

### Parcels
3D models can be placed on a Parcel in Substrata. A Parcel does have a size of 20m x 20m:

AngellXR/OMI-Open-Metaverse-Interoperability,,"# Open Metaverse Interoperability Protocol - sunsetting for new omigroup federated page 

---

### NOTE: The metaverse is for everyone, therefore we believe anyone can add value. If you see an opportunity to improve our work, please dive in. Whether you can code or not, this is bigger than us all.

## The Open Inventory Project (need new name) is an open source protocol for sharing assets and items across the Metaverse.

With the accelerated creation of Metaverses and video games, we want to build an open inventory system that allows users to take their gear/loot with them.

Users can travel across worlds and level up their gear. When you buy a skin in a game, you can use it in other similar games. When you mint a starship you can use it in space themed games, etc.

We all love our loot. Sometimes that's 80% of the fun.

We'd like the repo to be open. Indy devs could run a simple npm i AngellXR/metaloot (or something like that) to access an open repo of assets for their games. Devs can set tags of what is and isn't allowed in their world.

This could really scale. Imagine owning your gear, and yes this works with NFTs but it could also be simpler than that for more generic items (like Assets you don't have to own).

My ask: I have been preaching this for nearly a decade and the time has come. I am ready to spearhead this project, but alas, I cannot develop it alone. I'd like it to be open source. I need help getting this kick-started so that it's not a product manager asking for developers, but instead, a community of creators working together.

---

The above is very much describing a User Interface that would use an federated Interoperability protocol. We are now working together to create that Protocol, which will be open source, and available for any other omni-verse or ""metaverse"" to utilize.

Once the protocol is live, in some form of baseline, we can create essentially two types of servers: Home and Content Servers

- content servers hold virtual worlds and items and such
  - Pepsi sponsored content, or an event, or a title game like Call of Duty would have a content server
- Home servers
  - spaces where people can sign up (like AngellXR / Webaverse / etc.)
  - Like allowing a user to choose their Crypto Wallet or Mastadon Server

---

This is an open source project. I am a Product Manager capable of helping, but this is much larger than me. I hope we can come together to create a more user-centered standard that empowers creators, and experiencers alike.

We are not looking to hyper focus on NFT's. NFT's (especially clean NFTs PoS) serve an ideal purpose for ""owned"" assets or swords that ""level up"" across different games and experiences. However, many assets won't require minting or ownership. A standard sword, or default starship for example may not require that level of ownership, and in some cases, may literally only call for a GLTF or even a png file (depending on the dimensions of course)

Please pull, submit PR's, and self-regulate as needed. AngellXR will prepare a backlog for us to work from once we get to our first alpha. I recommend keeping it simple and establishing a bseline for testing before getting any more complex than that.

If we choose to work together, we can achieve so much more. Thank you for your time.

List of all Networking Resources for Metaverse

Reference: https://gitlab.com/Juankz/realtime-network-sync-godot/raw/master/README.md
If you want to learn games networking properly I recommend the book [Multiplayer Game Programming: Architecting Networked Games](https://www.amazon.com/Multiplayer-Game-Programming-Architecting-Networked/dp/0134034309) by Joshua Gazler and Sanjay madhav.

This demo itself takes inspiration from the GDC talk [Networking for physics programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9X4lysFr64) by Glenn Fieddler and the [Fast-Paced Multiplayer article series](https://www.gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture.html) by Gabriel Gambetta.

- [PlayerPhysicsSync Example Project (Unity / PUN 2)](https://github.com/ColeChittim/PlayerPhysicsSync) **Very interesting example to use everyone**

It is a wrapper for C# and I have created a simple game client and server with that repo for Unity. The result is perfect, it works. May be it helps you.

Here you can find the example repos.
https://github.com/erdinckaya/prometheus - for Client
https://github.com/erdinckaya/themis - for Server

Last time I checked, the only thing that is missing is yojimbo.net didn't implemented secure connection, however you can define your secure server to establish secure connection.

JScott/mvml,JavaScript,"# MVML

The official MVML interpreter. Converts to HTML/WebGL to view 3D spaces in your browser.

## Goal

WebGL finally lets us share 3D worlds with each other but it's still restricted to those with advanced code knowledge. Even the wonderful [three.js](http://threejs.org/) framework requires [considerable boilerplate](http://jsfiddle.net/5hgbu/) to get results. MVML aims to enable your average content-creator to display their browser content in 3D at least as easily as they would in HTML for 2D.

# Getting started

Download the zip from the `dist` folder and add the scripts to your site.

To use the API, follow the example of `spec.html`. Happy building!

# Building it yourself

`npm install`

`gulp zip`

Then just use the new distribution in `dist`.

## About

Metaverse.dev is an open source project dedicated to helping people become new or improved metaverse creators. AngellXR is incubating this effort collaboratively with other creators, maintainers, and teams. This effort recently re-kicked-off, and we hope you will join us in making it a success. 

### How to get involved 

We meet on the second* Monday of every month at 21:05 UTC :calendar: add these events to your [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NDMwbjVvNm1oMnN2ajZvZm9oZzA1djUyNDBfMjAyMjA0MDRUMjEwNTAwWiBqZXNzZUBhbmdlbGx4ci5jb20&tmsrc=jesse%40angellxr.com&scp=ALL)

We use Github to self organize around github [milestones](https://github.com/AngellXR/metaversedev/milestones) and [discussions](https://github.com/AngellXR/metaversedev/discussions).

One of our key assets for this effort is metaverse.dev, which we believe should be used for an open source knowledge sharing resource. How can we make it easier for people to achieve their goal of becoming a Metaverse creator? How can we share what we have learned, and guide others along the way? How can we ensure that the content we share is sustainably produced, and managed by the community rather than a small bottleneck? 

## :bulb: Why are we here? 

We want to organically create value by helping others become Metaverse creators and contributors. We want to find creative ways to sustain ourselves. We want to create incentive structures that align with peoples values. 

People need something that keeps them focused, and moving forward on their mission to get involved with the Metaverse. It can be easy to run into a roadblock, and get deflated or distracted. We want to make achieving the goal of becoming or improving as a Metaverse creator more attainable. We want to create incentive structures that align with peoples values. 

Furthermore, we should strive to deliver this message with minimal fluff or bullshit. The goal should be to enable folks to discover solutions and make effective choices, using _inclusive language_. 

Eventually we will have more options for metaverse contributors. Beyond developers, there will be metaverse designers, metaverse modelers, and even metaverse entertainers. Shops, services, SaaS. 


## :woman: Who is impacted by our work? 

- People building the Metaverse 
- People who want to become Metaverse developers 
- People who want to create Metaverse products
- People who want to share their knowledge with others 
- We are indirectly helping other groups in the Metaverse seeking future hires, by effectively manufacturing metaverse talent. 

## :dart: Goals: What do we hope to accomplish? (TBD)

### Objective I: Increase the number of Metaverse contributors and creators. 
### Objective II: Organically create sustainable value
Encourage people to tell their stories! How to use V-Sekai, how to become a Webaverse Developer, etc. 
### Objective III: Launch first curriculums*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sminnee/solipsism.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sminnee/solipsism)

Solipsism is a game-world database for bringing real-time multi-user support to your VR metaverse. It has integrations
with Three.js, Cannon.js, and Ammo.js, but it does not put constraints how you model your world: it is designed so that
you can write bindings between the Solipsism GameWorld and any representation you wish.

For example, you could bind to different representations of voxel objects, a limited number of pre-suppored 3D shapes,
or arbitrary meshes for CSG editing.

Companion projects: [solipsism-webvr](https://github.com/solipsismvr/solipsism-webvr) | [solipsism-ammo](https://github.com/solipsismvr/solipsism-ammo)

How it works
------------

Solopsism is built around 4 key concepts:

 * **GameWorld:** The GameWorld contains all the objects that make up your simulation. Each GameWorld has a unique
   identifier.
 * **GameObject:** The content of the GameWorld is made up entirely of GameObjects. Each object has a unique identififer,
   and owner (one of the GameWorlds), and a payload of properties. At this stage, objects can't be nested.
 * **WorldSyncer:** This will keep two GameWorlds in sync. It can do so over a web-socket or between a webworker and the
    main browser thread. Client-server communcation is handled by the WorldSyncer.
 * **Bindings:** Without bindings, your world may be kept in sync, but would be invisible. The bindings are used to connect
   your GameWorld and GameObjects to other systems, such as Three.js and Ammo.js.

Getting started
---------------

### A simple world

To start with, you can run single GameWorld in your browser's main thread. Create a new GameWorld object and call `add()` 
to create projects in it.

```js
var Sol = require('solipsism');

var world = new Sol.GameWorld('Client');

world.add({
  type: 'light',
  light: 'spotlight',
  color: 0xFFFFFF,
  position: [1,10,5],
});

world.add({
  geometry: { type: 'box', size: [ 2, 0.2, 2 ] },
  material: { type: 'lambert', color: 0x007700 },
  mass: 0,
  position: [0, -0.1, 0],
});

world.add({
  geometry: { type: 'sphere', radius: 0.5, widthSegments: 16, heightSegments: 16 },
  material: { type: 'phong',  color: 0xCC0000, shininess: 60 },
  mass: 5,
  position: [0, 1, 0],
}));
```

We can see that the representation of objects is quite simple: we don't have specialised vector objects, etc, we just
use 3-element arrays. GameObject properties are designed to be easily serialised as JSON.

The meaning of the GameObject's properties depends entirely on the bindings you use. However, some of the common
properties are as follows:

 * type: What kind of entitiy are we adding. This is optional and defaults to a body or mesh.
 * geometry: Specifies the shape of a body.
 * material: The visible material of a body.
 * position: A 3-element array (`[x, y, z]`) of the object's position.
 * quaternion: A 4-element array (`[x, y, z, w]`) of a quaternion representing the object's orientation.
 * velocity: A 3-element array of the object's velocity.
 * angularVelocity: A 3-element array of the object's angular velocity.
 * mass: The mass of an object for physics simulations

### Binding to Three.js

Next you will want to see the game world. Solipsism works nicely with Three.js but makes minimal assumptions about how
you will use Three.js. A ThreeBinding object can connect your GameWorld to a THREE.Scene. The GameWorld's objects will
be synchronised into your scene, and from there, the rest is up to you.

```js
var Sol = require('solipsism');
var scene = new THREE.Scene();
var world = new Sol.GameWorld('Client');
world.addBinding(new Sol.ThreeBinding(require('three'), scene))
```

We assume you are familiar with THREE.js (if not, google for some tutorials), but here's a simple script to add a
camera and a full-window renderer to get you started. In general, you're encouraged to use whatever rendering approach
makes the most sense for your application.

```js
// Add a camera
var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera( 70, 1, 0.01, 100 );
camera.position.z = 3;
camera.position.y = 1;
camera.aspect = window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight;
camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
scene.add(camera);

// Add a renderer
var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
renderer.setSize( window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight );
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

At this point you should be able to see a red ball hovering above a green box.

### Customising the binding

The default ThreeBinding is not supposed to be an exhaustive system out of the box. It has a few basic objects to get 
you started, but to build your own unique metaverse you will probably want to customise the bindings to suit your world
model.

For example, you can use `addGeometry()` to support a new kind of geometry in the THREE.js binding.

```js
threeBinding.addGeometry('cylinder', function (props) {
  props = Object.assign({ segments: 16 }, props)
  return new THREE.CylinderGeometry(props.radius, props.radius, props.height, props.segments, 1);
})

world.add({
  geometry: { type: 'cylinder', radius: 0.25, height: 0.5 },
  material: { type: 'phong',  color: 0x0000CC, shininess: 60 },
  mass: 5,
  position: [0.5, 1, 0],
}));
```

Similar functions exist for `addMaterial()`, `addLight()` and `addType()`. You may want to use this to add support for
voxels, heightfields, or CSG-generated meshes.

If you wish to use a callback to handle loading, you cna use `addGeometryLoader()`, `addTypeLoader()`, etc. For example,
here is how you might add support for using .obj files to define geometry.

```js
// OBJLoader can be copied from Three.JS examples
threeBinding.addGeometryLoader('obj', function (props, callback) {
  var loader = new OBJLoader();
  loader.load('models/' + props.filename, function (object) {
    callback(object.children[0]);
  }
});

world.add({
  geometry: { type: 'obj', filename: 'vr_controller_vive_1_5.obj' },
  material: { type: 'phong',  color: 0x777777, shininess: 60 },
  mass: 5,
  position: [0.5, 1, 0],
}));
```

Adding physics
--------------

As well as rendering scenes, bindings can also be used to incorporate physics. A separate package, `silverstripe-ammo`,
provdies integration with the Ammo.js physics engine.

To add physics to your scene, first set up the binding:

```
var Sol = require('solipsism');
var AmmoBinding = require('solipsism-ammo');

var world = new Sol.GameWorld('Client');
var physics = new AmmoBinding();
world.add(physics);
```

Then you will need to call the binding's `step()` function at a reasonable framerate:

```
// Run the physics engine at 50 FPS
var lastTime = (new Date()).getTime();
function step() {
  setTimeout(step, 20);

  var thisTime = (new Date()).getTime();
  physics.step(thisTime - lastTime);
  lastTime = thisTime;
}

```

Client-server operation
-----------------------

Running a GameWorld on a single client is of limited usefulness. Solipsism is designed to be used to keep a server
and many clients in sync.

This simple server is a good place to start.

```js
var express = require('express');
var socket = require('socket.io');
var Sol = require('solipsism');

var world = new Sol.GameWorld('Server');

// Create your gameworld
world.add(...);

// Set up a server and websocket on port 3001
var app = express();
var server = require('http').Server(app);
var io = socket(server);
server.listen(3001);

// Set up a game server
var gameServer = new Sol.GameServer(world);
io.on('connection', gameServer.addSocketClient.bind(gameServer));
```

Your client can be updated by replacing the `world.add()` commands with a Socket.io connection.

```js
var Sol = require('solipsism');
var io = require('socket.io');

var world = new Sol.GameWorld('Client');

var socket = io.connect('http://' + window.location.hostname + ':3001');
var sync = new Sol.WorldSyncer(world);
sync.connect(new WorldSyncer.Socket(socket));
```

### How does it work?

The key to Solipsism's client-server operation is the WorldSyncer class. It will propagate any changes made to the 
GameWorld between a local copy and a remote copy on the far side of a connection such as a websocket.

In this example, each client creates a WorldSyncer, and a separate WorldSyncer is created on the server for each client
that connects.

Bidirectional synchronisation can easily lead to infinite loops and conflicts, and so to manage this, every GameObject
has an owner. When a new object is created, its owner will be set to the identifier of the GameWorld that it is created
within. Changes for a GameObject should originate from its owner; although other GameWorlds may make changes to objects
that they don't own (e.g. for extrapolating the results of physics), in the case of any conflicts, the owner's values
take precedence.

A good rule of thumb is that a client should own any objects that the player has direct control of. For example, the
objects representing a player's camera or controllers should be owned by the client.

By default, both the GameWorld and the WorldSyncer will only broadcast changes to objects that it owns. This is fine
when you have 2 GameWorlds connect, but once you have multiple clients, the server's behaviour 

 * Client: send the server all objects that it owns
 * Server: server the client all objects except those that the client owns

The GameServer class provides the implementation of this logic, setting the GameWorld to broadcast all changes, and
then providing the approprirate client-specific filter when creating a new WorldSyncer.

### Limit the traffic volume

Sending 60-90 updates a second of the avatar position is likely to overwhelm the web socket and lead to degraded
and inconsistent performance. We can get a good result with much less frequent updates, e.g. 10/second.

If you provide the `updateInterval` option as part of the 2nd argument to `sync.connect()`, we can cache updates
and send them periodically. The value is in milliseconds, so 100 will mean 10/second.

```js
sync.connect(new WorldSyncer.Socket(socket), { updateInterval: 100 });
```

<h1>MUNDIS</h1>
<h3>Layer 0 Blockchain Node</h3>
</div>

# TL;DR
The role of L0 is to coordinate the Mundis metaverse. It's a core blockchain based on the Solana codebase that features a global timeline of events with an optimized pBFT replicated state machine that can do sub-second finality times. It runs on a globally distributed ""clock"" with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, built to address the needs of our Metaverse.

The global ""clock"" is not a consensus algorithm but a computational algorithm that provides a way to cryptographically verify the ordering of events to solve the agreement on global time. It's a VDF hash-chain used to checkpoint L1 chains and coordinate global consensus. It allows near-instant finality up to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.

The L0 chain needs actors that can process transactions and participate in consensus. These actors are named validators in existing blockchains, but in Mundis, we call them **Architects**.

Architects are the keepers of the Metaverse. Besides validation tasks for transactions and consensus, they also participate in global governance. Therefore, it is desirable to have many Architects for the ecosystem to be decentralized, and Mundis does not limit this number as some existing blockchains do. As the Metaverse grows, more Architects will be needed to increase the performance of the ecosystem.

빼빼로를 만들고 메시지와 함께 줄 수 있는 간단한 웹 풀스택 프로젝트입니다.


# 기술 스택 - 프론트엔드
## React
당연히 훅 기반으로 만들었습니다. 최대한 적당하게 컴포넌트를 분리하려 하였으나 역시 빠르게 작업하다보면 리팩토링 하는 데에 쉽지 않네요. 그래도 리액트 훅은 여전히 신선합니다. 개인적으로 이거 만든 사람은 정말 똑똑한 게 아닌가 싶어요.

## Recoil
사실 전역 상태관리가 그다지 필요하지는 않습니다. 다만 인증 정보와 로그인 회원 정보는 전역으로 관리 할 필요가 있어서 그 부분에만 사용하고 있습니다.

## SWR
경험상 대부분의 프론트엔드 작업은 국지적으로 원격의 값을 보여주는 작업이었습니다. 이 페이지의 값이 다른 페이지에 연동 되거나 해서 전역으로 상태를 관리 할 일은 그다지 많지 않았죠. SWR은 그런 환경에서 데이터를 가져오는 데에 매우 효율적인 솔루션을 제공합니다. 데이터를 가져오고, 또 필요한 경우 다른 페이지에서 같은 값을 표현해줄 때 아주 편리했습니다.

## Emotion
개인적으로 StyledComponents보다는 Emotion쪽이 더 편했습니다. 다만 시간관계상 재사용성을 아주 고려해서 짜진 않았어요. 그리고 상위 요소에만 Emotion의 css속성을 넣어두고 나머지 하위 요소들은 대부분 className을 부여해서 Emotion css에 selector로 불러와 관리했습니다.

## JWT
이것도 기술 스택이라 불러도 되나 모르겠지만 아무튼 JWT를 사용해서 인증을 처리합니다. 만료 기한이 짧은 AccessToken과 만료 기한이 긴 RefreshToken으로 구성 되어 인증 응답을 보내며, RefreshToken은 로컬 스토리지에 저장해두고 AccessToken이 만료 될 경우 Refresh를 하도록 했습니다. `api.js` 파일에 해당 내용이 있어요

# 기술스택 - 백엔드
## ASP.Net Core 5
이 프로젝트를 닷넷(.Net)5로 생성하자 마자 닷넷6가 출시되었습니다(...) 그래서 NuGet(패키지매니저)에서는 닷넷6 기반의 패키지를 받아오려고 하고 프로젝트는 닷넷5 기반이라 꼬이는 일이 있었네요. 아무튼 제가 애정하는 웹 개발 프레임워크인 ASP.Net Core를 백엔드 프레임워크로 사용했습니다.

보통 어느정도 규모가 되는 프로젝트의 경우 많은 기능을 Controller 레이어에 배치하지 않고 Service 레이어에 배치하는데, 이 프로젝트는 규모가 워낙 작아서 Controller에 대부분의 로직이 들어가있습니다.

## Entity Framework Core
ORM입니다. EF Core의 방대한 기능에 비해 정말 민망할 정도로 기능을 사용하지 않았습니다. 그냥 간단하게 조회하고 저장하는 용도로 씁니다.

AtlasFoundation/Magrathea,C#,"# Magrathea

Export pipeline for Unity3D to the Metaverse

Uses open source code from the following projects
- [SeinJS](https://github.com/hiloteam)
- [Webaverse](https://github.com/webaverse)
- [Atlas Engine](https://github.com/atlasfoundation/atlasengine)
- [XREngine](https://github.com/xrfoundation/xrengine)

# System Requirements
Unity >2020
Bakery Lightmapper (optional)
Meshbaker (optional)

## Getting Started

Export any Unity scene as a GLB with menu item Magrathea->Export Scene. This will bring up an export configuration window. 

### Export Parameters
**Name**: name of the GLTF and GLB files. Enter without file extension.

**Set Output Directory**: Set to your target Magrathea project directory. By default, the scene will be exported into the /Outputs/GLB/ folder.

**Export Components**: Options for exporting specific component types

**Export**: Begins an export. Note that if you have a game object selected in editor, then only the selection is exported.

### Supported Components
**Lights**: point and direction light are currently supported.

**Cameras**: 

**Lightmaps**: Lightmaps are supported in two different export options:

***BAKE_COMBINED***: lightmaps are automatically combined with the diffuse channel and reprojected onto the mesh's uv0, then exported as an unlit material. Note that this will cause issues with instanced geometry.

***BAKE_SEPARATE***: lightmaps are exported as-is and loaded into the lightmap in the standard mesh material. Mesh uv2s are adjusted to apply lightmap scale and offset. 

**Colliders**: box and mesh colliders are automatically configured and exported in Magrathea compatible format.

**LODs**: LOD Groups in Unity are automatically configured and exported. 

**Spawn Points**: Spawn points are exported by adding the ***Spawn Point*** script onto transforms in the scene. 

**Instancing**: Any Gameobjects which share the same mesh and material will be instanced by default. Currently only meshes with one material are supported. As previously noted, baking lightmaps onto Gameobjects that share the same mesh and material will break instancing.

**Skybox**: If the scene has a skybox with a valid cubemap, then it is exported into the project. Currently only supports one cubemap per project.

### GLTF Optimization

This exporter uses a custom version of the gltfpack and meshoptimizer binary executable. Configure at your own risk -- engine support for all gltfpack optimization features is ongoing and currently error prone.

**Instanced Meshes**: gltfpack will attempt to instance all scene elements that share the same mesh and materials. Currently not working

**KTX2 Compression**: compresses textures using ktx2. This takes a long time but is extremely effective at reducing export file sizes

**Meshopt Compression**: compresses meshes using meshoptimizer algorithms. Currently mesh quantization is not supported

**Combine Materials**: attempts to merge all similar materials in the scene. Currently no observable changes occur on exported scenes from Unity

**Combine Nodes**: attempts to combine as many nodes as possible together to reduce draw calls. Currently causes meshes to break upon import to XRE editor

### Recommended Workflow

Split your scene into two parts: a ""base"" scene and a ""colliders"" scene. In the base scene, use this configuration:

![Unity_BH46tkMq3i](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94419856/157543849-b7620572-8828-4b95-ba1d-fc0973fb5b11.png)

(Instancing, Meshopt, KTX2 Compression enabled, colliders, lights disabled)

This exported file will contain all geometry, and can be optimized significantly.

In the colliders scene, use this configuration:

![Unity_8kUeAC3nFA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94419856/157544345-dd1d6171-1ba9-4374-b65e-40cda6d24497.png)

(everything disabled except for colliders)

This will export the collider information in an XRE supported format. Meshopt compression breaks collider imports into XRE so leave this file unoptimized.

### Advanced Tools

**Serialize Into Persistent Assets**: This project uses GLTFast to import GLB and GLTF files into Unity. By default the imported assets are read-only, and do not have their own asset paths, which are required to correctly export using our exporter. Thus there is an intermediate step where all assets are duplicated and placed in either the ""Assets/Magrathea/PipelineAssets"" folder or the ""Assets/Magrathea/PersistentAssets"" folder. PipelineAssets is automatically cleared after each export operation, while PersistentAssets is manually maintained. It is highly recommended that, when using any advanced tools, this option is toggled on.

**Serialize Selected/All**: Performs the GLTF asset duplication upon either the current selected objects, or the entire loaded scene.

**Deserialize Selected/All**: Resets either selected or all objects in scene to original GLTF assets.

**Do MeshBake**: Performs Meshbaker operations as defined by ***Mesh Bake*** Monobehaviors placed in scene.

**Undo MeshBake**: All operations performed by the ***Mesh Bake*** monobehaviors are undone.

**Revert Backups**: Searches project for asset backup folders and performs a hard reset of all registered changes. Currently only materials are backed up into said folders.

## Known Issues

### Materials Black After Error During Export
In general, exceptions thrown during the SeinJS export will result in all materials in the scene being black. Quickly fix this after it occurs by selecting menu item Assets->Materials->Restore Materials.

### No Default Materials Allowed
Every material in the scene must be a project asset that resides somewhere within the Assets folder. Materials from unity's default asset registry will cause the exporter to fail."

## Who needs ICON?

- If you want to **Train & Evaluate** on **PIFu / PaMIR / ICON** using your own data, please check [dataset.md](./docs/dataset.md) to prepare dataset, [training.md](./docs/training.md) for training, and [evaluation.md](./docs/evaluation.md) for benchmark evaluation.


- Given a raw RGB image, you could get:
  - image (png): 
    - segmented human RGB
    - normal maps of body and cloth
    - pixel-aligned normal-RGB overlap
  - mesh (obj):
    - SMPL-(X) body from *PyMAF, PIXIE, PARE, HybrIK, BEV*
    - 3D clothed human reconstruction

mvs-org/metaverse-vm-scraper,JavaScript,"# State migration

This script allows bootstrapping a `New-frontiers` chain with the snapshot state of `Hyperspace` chain. Basically it's a state storage migration from `Hyperspace`.

**State storage:**

- EVM account balance
- EVM contract storage

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse-vm-scraper.git
    cd metaverse-vm-scraper
    npm i
    ```

3. Copy the executable/binary of the `New-frontiers` node inside the `src/data` folder and rename it to `binary`.

4. Copy the runtime WASM blob of the `New-frontiers` runtime to the `src/data` folder and rename it to `runtime.wasm`. To get the WASM blob, compile `New-frontiers` and look for `./target/release/wbuild/runtime/runtime.compact.wasm`. 

5. Copy the additional `Hyperspace` types to the `src/data` folder and rename it to `schema.json`.

6. Either run a full `Hyperspace` node locally(Recommended) or have an external endpoint handy.

7. Run the script
    * If using a local node, simply run the script using (`BLOCK_NR` is for block height, default is ""latest"")

        ```bash
        BLOCK_NR=500000 node src/fork.js
        ```

    * If you are using an external/non-default endpoint, you need to provide it to the script via the `HTTP_RPC_ENDPOINT` environment variable

        ```bash
        BLOCK_NR=500000 RPC_URL=http://example.com WS_URL=ws://example.com node src/fork.js
        ```

8. You should have the genesis file for the forked chain inside the `data` folder. It will be called `fork.json`.

9. You can now run a `New-frontiers` chain using this genesis file

    ```bash
    ./binary --chain fork.json --alice
    ```

Spacetime-Meta/spacetime-sdk,JavaScript,"# 👋 Spacetime SDK 🛰️
The Spacetime standard kit provide developers with turnkey virtual environments. This package will provide multiple metaverse features like multiplayer, custom avatars, vehicle and blockchain connection. 

We are making this codebase open source and free to use by our [community]([discord-url]) members and partners in order to facilitate the standardization of the metaverse.

## Main Focus

This standard kit project was initially started to populate [this universe](https://www.spacetimemeta.io/#/map) with uniquely generated worlds. It has now extended to much more. As multiple other projects use our open source kit to create their own virtual environments and connect them to the spacetime metaverse. 

**Partners and contributors should keep in mind that; even as the project gets more traction, our main focus will always be on populating the space chunks with complete worlds and valuable experiences. Also, every feature will be reviewed and developed in orientation to the spacetime meta roadmap.**

## How to run in `local`

**Goal: Run a simple environment with avatar, ui, multiplayer and cardano wallet connection:**  
*If you are just looking to develop an environment, the [base template](https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/base-template) is probably what you are looking for. The spacetime-sdk is meant for developpers who wants to add new features into the metaverse.*

**First**, clone the repo and install the dependencies a the root.
```
git clone https://github.com/Spacetime-Meta/spacetime-sdk.git
cd spacetime-sdk
npm install
```
**Second**, configure the cardano connection.
For this you need to create a config file in `src/cradano/config.js`.
This config file must contains your blockfrost api keys in the following format:
```javascript
const blockfrostApiKey = {
    0: ""testnet..."", // testnet
    1: ""mainnet..."" // mainnet
}
export default blockfrostApiKey;
```
**Third**, install the dependencies of the cardano folder.
```
cd src/cardano
npm install
cd ../..
```
**Finaly**, once all the steps are completed, you will be able to run the sdk using `npm run start`.
This will start a server on your local machine and the examples will be available at `http://localhost:8080/`

## How to use the sdk

To use the sdk in your webpage, you first need to get it from a source.
```
<script src=""http://localhost:8080/bundle.min.js""></script>
```

Then you have access to the `VirtualEnvironment` class in the window.
To instanciate a new VirtualEnvironment, you need to pass it a config.

```javascript
// simply call the virtual env with your config 
const virtualEnvironment = new VirtualEnvironment(""./configs/devPlanet.json"");

// then start the animation
animate();
function animate() {
    virtualEnvironment.update();
    requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
```
If everything works properly, you should see something like [this world](https://www.spacetimemeta.io/metaverse/spawn-planet)

## Using

There are several different ways to use JanusWeb, depending on how much control you want to 
have over the whole system.

### Use our viewer
Our default viewer is always available at https://web.janusvr.com/.  You can write an HTML
page with your [JanusVR Markup](https://janusvr.com/docs/build/introtojml/index.html) and host
it anywhere you would normally host a static website.  Any regular webhost, AWS S3 static 
sites, CDNs, or even more exotic locations like [IPFS distributed filesystems](https://ipfs.io) will work.
You can even put your mark-up onto sites like PasteBin or PiratePad.  Then just load the URL
in our viewer by entering the URL into the navigation bar, and you can link directly to it, share 
on social media, or embed our viewer directly into other webpages, blog posts, or articles.

### Pull our scripts into your page
Using the above method, all of your links would go through our servers.  If you'd prefer to 
link to your own servers, you can pull our JS into your page and use JanusWeb as a scriptable
client via its API.  This looks something like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My JanusVR Room</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src=""https://web.janusvr.com/janusweb.js""></script>
    <janus-viewer>
      <FireBoxRoom>
        <Room use_local_asset=""room1"">
          <Object id=""cube"" pos=""0 1 5"" />
          <Text col=""1 0 0"" pos=""0 2 4"">My First Room</Text>
        </Room>
      </FireBoxRoom>
    </janus-viewer>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `elation.janusweb.init()` function can take a number of arguments, and returns a promise which
receives an instance of the client.  This client reference can be controlled via its API.  See the 
sections on **Arguments** and **Scripting** below.

See also **Using a specific version of JanusWeb** below.

### Install from ZIPs
(TODO - we will start shipping zip builds of JanusWeb once we release v1.0)

### Install from NPM
(TODO - we will start shipping official NPM packages of JanusWeb once we release v1.0)
```bash
npm install janusweb
```

### Build from source

If you'd like to build JanusWeb from source, you can check it out from Github and build using the 
following steps:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jbaicoianu/janusweb
$ cd janusweb
$ npm install --only=prod
$ npm run build
```

This will give you a full build of the latest verson of JanusWeb in your `build/` directory.  You 
can then modify `build/index.html` however you see fit, and host it as suggested above.

## Arguments
JanusWeb supports several arguments at initialization time to control how it behaves.

<table>
  <tr><th> Name           </th><th> Description                            </th><th> Default                  </th></tr>

</table>

## Scripting
After initializing the client, `elation.janusweb.init()` returns a Promise which provides a reference to the client.
You can programatically control this client to do all sorts of things.  For instance, we can make the client load a
URL, wait for the world and all of its assets to load, and then take a screenshot of the world after a specified delay:

```javascript
var pageinfo = elation.utils.parseURL(document.location.href),
    urlargs = pageinfo.args || {},
    hashargs = pageinfo.hash || {};

var url = elation.utils.any(hashargs.url, urlargs.url, 'http://www.janusvr.com/index.html'),
    delay = elation.utils.any(hashargs.delay, urlargs.delay, 1000);

elation.janusweb.init({
  url: url,
  resolution: '1920x1080',
  showchat: false,
  shownavigation: false
}).then(function(client) {
  elation.events.add(client.janusweb.currentroom, 'room_load_complete', function() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      client.hideMenu();
      client.screenshot().then(function(imagefile) {
        // upload imagefile somewhere via XHR
        console.log('Screenshot complete!');
      });
    }, delay);
  });
});

```

Many other aspects of the JanusWeb client can be controlled this way as well.  Our users are
always thinking up new and inventive ways of using the JanusWeb client.  Embed it in your blog
posts, use it to render 3D content behind your 2d webpage, put a virtual security camera in your
world and view a live stream of the virtual world from any web browser.  Control the virtual world
via a web interface.  This is your scriptable live portal into the metaverse, to do with whatever
you please.  The possibilities are endless!

You can even run JanusWeb in NodeJS for headless server-side operations.  Use it to write a bot that
wanders the metaverse, or run your game logic and physics on a server to have one authoritative 
source of state for your world.  If this sounds interesting to you let us know, we will be more
than happy to help you through this (it's all very experimental right now!)

## Using a specific version of JanusWeb
If you need to load a specific version of JanusWeb, all previous versions are stores on the same server, and can be accessed by construction a URL of the form ```https://web.janusvr.com/<version>/```.  This is useful if you have a room which you know works with a specific version, which relies on features which have since been deprecated or changed, or to determine whether bugs have been introduced.  

JanusWeb versions follow the [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) spec, which follows the format ```<major>.<minor>.<patch>``` - for example, at the time of writing (March 2017) the current stable release is **1.0.15**.  So if you want to view this version, you could go to https://web.janusvr.com/1.0.15/ and if you wanted to pull this specific version into your page, you could do so with ```<script src=""https://web.janusvr.com/1.0.15/janusweb.js""></script>```.  We also support aliases for the most current version - for instance, https://web.janusvr.com/1.0/ will always refer to the most recent 1.0 release, https://web.janusvr.com/0.9/ the final 0.9 release, etc.

## Contributing
JanusWeb is open source, and we welcome any contributions!  Please do report bugs using GitHub Issues,
and all pull requests will be considered.  We could especially use help with documentation!

## Who is responsible for this?
JanusWeb was created by James Baicoianu, and is now an official open source project of JanusVR, Inc.
The JanusWeb software and its API are published under the MIT license, and are free to use for whatever
uses you can think of.  If you build something cool, let us know!
"
expenses/mateversum,Rust,"# Mateversum 🍾

Mateversum (pronounced: MAH-tay-ver-sum) is a peer-to-peer WebXR metaverse project.

The idea is that you'd be able to connect to a network of peers, load into a room, choose an avatar and hang out, all without any central servers. Inside a web browser.

Some of this sort-of works at the moment, but it's got a long way to go.

![](readme/networking.png)

_Real time networking between a browser on a laptop running the [WebXR API Emulator] extension and a browser on an android phone running in AR mode. I threw this very quickly so the lighting and bottle model could be better._

## Running It

Mateversum is really not fit for any kind of public use right now. That said, you can try out an online version at: https://github.com/expenses/webxr-pbr-wasm (I'm going to change the address for that at some point). Simply wait for it to load the initial WASM blob and click 'Start VR' on a desktop (with the [WebXR API Emulator] extension) or 'Start AR'. The default models/textures are pretty huge (250 mb or so) so I recommend doing this on a decent wifi connection. They'll be cached after the initial load though.

## Compiling It

On a Unix/WSL machine run `sh run.sh` to compile Mateversum and start a local server. You'll need Rust, [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) and the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) HTTP server (or equivalent) for this.

### Compiling the shaders

Because we're especially cool, we use [rust-gpu](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) for the GPU shaders. Run `sh compile_shaders.sh` to compile these, but the script needs some special stuff to be installed for that I can't be bothered documenting it yet.

### Compiling the javascript for networking

The javascript code that we use for networking can be built by `cd`ing into `networking-js`, running `npm install` followed by `npm run build`.

## A Few Implementation Details

We support models in the brilliant [glTF](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) format. The core of glTF is a JSON file that references both binary geometry data blobs and texture files as external URLs. These URLs can be delivered either by standard HTTP/HTTPS or ([IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) (currently only through a gateway but we'll hopefully use [js.ipfs.io](https://js.ipfs.io/) soon.)). We support textures files in the [KTX 2](https://github.khronos.org/KTX-Specification/) format. This lets us load textures progressively up from 1x1 pixel [mipmaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mipmap) all the way to 4096x4096 and beyond (with adjustable limits so that you can control bandwidth and memory).

Peer-to-peer networking is done via WebRTC. It's extremely bare-bones at the moment, with everyone just connecting to a single room and sending the position of their hand and hands to everyone else. WebRTC requires you to do a handshake where one peer sends a session descriptor offer packet to another peer, who then sends an answer packet back.

The transmission of these packets has to happen over an existing channel, usually using what's known as a signalling server. We're currently using Webtorrent trackers as signalling servers using the [trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) library, but using a [custom fork](https://github.com/expenses/trystero/tree/key-signing) that cryptographically signs the packets to prevent a bad server from performing a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM).

Ideally we'd use libp2p for most if not all networking, but their WebRTC support isn't especially stable yet. See https://github.com/libp2p/specs/issues/220.

livelaughHODL/Metaverse,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

yomorun/yomo-vhq-backend,Go,"# YoMo Showcase: Implement an Virtual HQ Presence Service with Geo-Distributed Cloud 

This showcase demonstrates how to build a realtime [Presence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presence_information) Sync Service of [Metaverse Workplace - Virtual Headquarters](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/) with Geo-distributed Cloud Architecture by [YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo) and [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/).

Nowadays, users care about low-latency event streaming. But backend services usually deployed to a dedicated cloud region and CDN is used for static resources. We need a CDN-like architecture but for upstreaming data and realtime computing. This showcase introduce a easy way to reach the goal.

## 🧑🏼‍🏫 Architecture Explanation

There are 3 parts in this Realtime Presence Sync Service: 

1. **Websocket Server**: accepts WebSocket connections from Web Browsers
2. **Presence Sender Service**: a YoMo Server responsible for dispatch presence to other nodes
3. **Presence Receiver Service**: a YoMo Server responsible for recieving presence from Senders

By YoMo, we create an event stream from Bob to Alice, sync all presence from Bob to Alice. Assume Bob and Alice are both in Europe, they connect to the same mesh node: 

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://github.com/yomorun/yomo-vhq-backend/raw/main/vhq-1-single_mesh_arch.jpg"" width=""600"">
</p>

But When Bob is in Italy 🇮🇹 while Alice is in US 🇺🇸, the presence flow will be like below, it's done automatically by YoMo:

![YoMo for Geo-Distributed Mesh Networks](vhq-2-geo_mesh_arch.jpg)

In this showcase, we separate presence sync flow to 2 parts, one is `Sender`, responsible for `Dispatching presence`, another is for `Receiving presence`. Every `Sender` will dispatching presence to every `Receivers`:

<p align=""center"">
<img src=""https://github.com/yomorun/yomo-vhq-backend/raw/main/vhq-3-send-msg.jpg"" width=""600"">
</p>

YoMo care about security, presence in `Sender` and `Receiver` are encrypt by TLS v1.3 by default on [every datagram](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-quic-tls-34):

# The Nexus

The Nexus is an open source, community-driven, CC0 city for the open metaverse.

- Bring The Nexus to the places your people already are
- Fork it and modify it to fit your community
- Build with us and be part of something that will exist forever for anyone to use

## Setup Instructions
The project uses vanilla Blender 3.0 or above. For the best experience, use the latest version.
You don't need any special plugins or anything. If you've never used Blender, start here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw

## Installation Instructions
Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/thenexuscity/thenexus && cd thenexus
```

You shouldn't need to do anything special after that.

## Contributions Welcome
Any contributions will be reviewed. Thank you for your contributions.

Please post photos to make it easy, and try to remove any unused or unlinked assets to keep your files small. Deleting orphan files and removing unused assets will keep out GitHub from exploding. Here's a tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59IU_tPH4Hs

Clean up orphans using this command in blender.

Make sure to have this settings on blender to keep assets at minimum to keep the files small:

### Adding New Assets and Commiting Them
When you have made something you want to add to The nexus then you can add it to your git and push it with GitHub Desktop or command line, depending on your preference.

If you are unfamiliar with shell scripting in the terminal then the Desktop version is probably easier: https://desktop.github.com/
Here's a tutorial for how to use it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPagOAUx2SQ

```sh
git add <filename>.blend
git commit -m ""Added <feature> to <filename>
git push
```

Shell looks scary at first, but it actually pretty simple, and it's worth getting into.
You can find a tutorial for this kind of shell scripting here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtovwKDemnI

If you don't (yet) feel comfortable using Git in the terminal, this video tutorial may be helpful:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc

##### We can build anything if we do it together.

An open, flexible, and secure online virtual reality system.

## 💡About
**Mondeto** is an online, multiplayer virtual reality system which has this three features:
1. 📖**Open:** Mondeto is an open-source software, not a service. **Everybody can setup a server** on their own computer.
2. 🛠**Flexible:** VR objects can be **controlled by programs** using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/). Also you can modify Mondeto software itself to **connect new hardware with VR worlds**.
3. 🔒**Secure:** Communications are **encrypted** and WebAssembly codes are safely run inside **sandbox**. Despite being open and flexible, we do not sacrifice security.

## 💻Requirements
- 64-bit Windows computer
- For VR mode:
    - Oculus headset and controllers (🙇we are working on supporting other headsets🚧)
    - Oculus software installed

## Early Access Preview 05/2022

### Context

This project has been in my head my whole life, and covers fields as diverse as video games or my personal financial management. Since I was a child I have been passionate about digital and automotive media and the utilities they provide us. As a programmer and lover of video games, I recognized in them the power to create new worlds, and even replicas of the real world. However, with the spectacular growth of the software industry, our data and the way we interact with it has become fragmented. Some believe that NFTs have brought about the Metaverse. I personally believe that standards and operating systems must evolve to provide a truly free and accessible experience of the metaverse.

PS: Currently this project does not include any functionality implemented with BlockChain or NFTs. We plan to add support in the future but it will be totally optional and unnecessary to enjoy the experience.

### What is this

It is difficult to understand what this project is, without understanding its objective. This project is born in multiple occasions as my little personal dashboard, with a couple of links and useful stuff. The essence is to centralize all my data in a private place, and integrate all the possible services that I use in my day to day, detecting possible synergies where they exist. I thought about gamifying some of the tasks that were difficult for me and thus improve my overall productivity. When people started talking about the Metaverse, this project changed again. Suddenly it seemed that everyone wanted something similar (for example, to buy a pair of sneakers in the real world and have their avatar wear them in the digital world). I wanted that too, in my own little private virtual space. And now, 7 months later this virtual space is no longer private, I consider it my duty for all that Open Source has given me. I also don't want a world where to access a virtual space I need glasses and a Facevil Corp. account. I have always believed in the web as the real Metaverse, it was always there, only nobody dared to explore it in new ways. All the code is made with JavaScript technologies and can be run in a web browser with no problems. This is more of an OS or a Web Browser than a blockchain with NFTs at 45% commission. Honestly, it's an overly ambitious project, and I wouldn't do it if it wasn't the project of my life. Sometimes it's hard to talk about the project in areas like the Metaverse or Operating Systems, so I personally like to call it, my Monoverse.

### Roadmap for Humans

The first stable version (v1.0.0) will be released later this year.

My priority right now is to improve the user experience, fixing bugs and enabling the data writing layer.

Once this is done, I will start including the features that I consider a priority from the point of view of usability as an application:

* P2P chat rooms with video calling and streaming system.
* 2D pixel art explorable maps of procedural cities
* Inventory and equipment. Shopping system.
* First Battle and Role Playing System
* SDK Generators (TypeScript, GraphQL, Unreal)
* First free Single Player Campaign storyline

### If you have read this far

I would appreciate any kind of help or support with the project, either through feedback, both bugs and new proposals. Please take the time to explore the web or the code even with all its gaps and feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions. You can find me on GitHub as [D3v0ps](https://github.com/d3v0ps) or contact me directly at my email address: [aitorllj93@gmail.com](mailto:aitorllj93@gmail.com)

## Troubleshooting

### You need to make sure that /mnt/d/Workspace/metaverse/node_modules/electron/dist/chrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755

This is probably because you're running the app from a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) container. The easiest way to fix this is to install the Electron npm package for Windows:

```sh
# Uninstall the Electron package for Linux
npm uninstall electron
# Change npm config platform
export npm_config_platform=win32
# Install the Electron package for Windows
npm install electron
# Unset the environment variable
unset npm_config_platform
# Remove the changes in the package and package-lock files
```

This document describes the development and creation of the first Real Virtual World. Metaegg Metaverse will be a replica of the real universe. It will be developed using the best technologies available to overcome the current paradigm of the ""Metaverse"" and launch the user in a new era. What will be outlined is actually an idea, a project that we hope will soon become a reality. We believe it will be soon a reality, hoping that drawing a plot and describing what are the possibilities will encourage further progress and implementations.

Let's start from the correct definition of ""Metaegg Metaverse"": 3D  virtual environment of real-world around us created by the computer, shared with multiple users over the Internet with a persistent possibility of insertion, modification, and deletion of objects and agents and direct interaction through virtual devices. Furthermore programmable through a scripting language. 
The above definition only partially clarifies the possibilities offered by a Metaegg Metaverse. Here, then, is a brief ""manifesto"" that can detail more the characteristics of the Metaegg Metaverse project. 
A micro manifesto for the perfect ""Metaverse""**:**

* Immersive Virtual Reality: Immersive Virtual Reality, designed for a sense of ""presence"" and ""interaction"" at a high level. One should not think of a simple HMD viewer connected to an environment recreated on the computer, but of a platform that ""involves"" the user and above all gives him the possibility of interacting with other users, with objects, and also with automatic systems or systems guided by Artificial Intelligence.

* Open Source/Royalty Free protocols, standards, queues: the entire Metaverse source code should be released under Open Source lincense, but above all based on standards and non-proprietary protocols, open and certified by international bodies. Examples are the VRML standards and its evolution X3D which, however, after a period of good diffusion, have been ""forgotten"" by the IT industry. Recently, Carmack has also underlined this possibility with the creation of an open standard for describing a 3D scene and its transfer through the internet via glTF.

* Sandboxing User Generated contents In-World/Out-World: the ability to offer users tools for creating and editing any content within the virtualized environment is essential. The ability to import creations from other systems and software is also a goal that amplifies users' creativity and offers an unprecedented level of interaction. All current ""Metaverse"" offer this opportunity at various levels, which can then be specialized to create games, experiments and artistic forms of all kinds.

* Scripting system using software language as Javascript, C#, Go, Swift: directly correlated with the previous point is the need to program the entire environment through high-level languages. C#, Go and Swift seem to be perfect candidates even though the scene is currently dominated by Javascript. However, it is essential to give developers the option of creating links, automatically modifying the environment and interfacing it with other systems and platforms.

* Metaverse as protocol not only as API: it is quite obvious to think that the Metaverse exposes APIs, but it is even more important to assume and design a real protocol that allows different Metaverses to communicate with each other. . In the past, there have been several attempts such as MMOX, which has failed to overcome the draft state of the IETF.

* Crypto Currency inside Metaverse: Why not use Bitcoin or Ethereum directly? Despite many ads, still no Metaverse uses Crypto-currencies any kind to allow trade between users. This feature would instead make the platform unique and above all would involve the user more closely.

* Decentralized architectures: Almost all platforms for virtual worlds are based on classic client-server architecture. Moving to a peer-to-peer system would have enormous advantages. JanusVR, for example, allows you to use the incredible ipfs (Inter-Planetary File System) for the fast recovery of different assets.

Implementation of the Alfa version.

The software is currently only developed for Windows platform.

GoMeta/leaderboard,PHP,"# Metaverse Leaderboard Sample Project
This repository contains a simple leaderboard service that demonstrates how easy it is to integrate Metaverse with third-party APIs. This is a simple service, intended to be used as a tool to understand, in a practical way, how to interface between Metaverse and your custom service.

## Hosted leaderboard
If you would like you use leaderboards within your own dimension, you can either clone this project and deploy on your own host, or you can access our hosted leaderboard at `http://leaderboards.metaverseapp.io/`. Feel free to use this in production, however we cannot guarentee that it will be free from breaking changes.

To access a leaderboard the URL format is http://*host*/?id=*leaderboard_id*

## Implementing a leaderboard in your dimension
Leaderboards must be created manually, by making a POST request to `http://leaderboards.metaverseapp.io/api/create.php`. This can be done via the command line:

```
curl -X POST http://leaderboards.metaverseapp.io/api/create.php -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'name=NAME&logo=URL&description=DESCRIPTION'
```

A successful request will return an API key to be used in subsequent calls.

The leaderboard is then updated by making a POST request to `http://leaderboards.metaverseapp.io/api/update.php`. To configure Metaverse to update your leaderboard, you must use the Javascript sandboxes to make an update request in response to the event you would like to score. This can be done by hooking into the event system within your dimension to execute custom code in response to events.

If you would like to update a leaderboard in response to an event, such as an experience being completed in your dimension, register a new event handler in the ""Events"" page with the following options:

- Display name: `Increment leaderboard`
- Description: `Increment a user's rank on the leaderboard when they complete an experience`
- Event name: `experience_completed`
- Direct object: `*`
- Indirect object: `*`
- Code:
```
const user = await Meta.contexts.loadUser(Meta.data.event.subject);

Meta.actions.post('http://leaderboards.metaverseapp.io/api/update.php', {
  method: 'post',
  headers: {
    Accept: 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
  },
  body: `apikey=YOUR_API_KEY&username=${user.name}&increment=1`
});
```

You can substitute `experience_completed` with any event. For example, if you wanted to increment the leaderboard every time a user received an item such as a coin, you would create an event handler to listen for `item_received` events, with the direct object set as the ID of the item you are tracking.

The following API endpoints are available:
## /api/create.php
Create a new leaderboard, parameters required:
- **name:** Leaderboard name
- **logo:** URL to a logo image
- **description:** Description of the leaderboard

 -*Returns an 'apikey' for this database to be used in subsequent calls.*

## /api/modify.php
Modify an existing leaderboard:
- **apikey:** API Key for this leaderboard
- **name:** Leaderboard name
- **logo:** URL to a logo image
- **description:** Description of the leaderboard

## /api/delete.php
Soft Delete existing leaderboard:
- **apikey:** API Key for this leaderboard

## /api/update.php
Insert or update a user's score:
- **apikey:** API Key for this leaderboard
- **username:** User whose score is being modified.
- **increment:** Value to add to existing score.

## Character Animation Library ###
<img align=""right"" width=""160"" src=""/_images/Epic_MegaGrants_Recipient_logo.png?raw=true"">
This project is working toward a complete character skinning & animation library for the web. First most, this library is focused on being independent from any rendering engine with examples of how to use it in webgl based engines like threejs. The one big focus is recreating the IK Rig & IK Animations type system that was demoed several years ago from Ubisoft's GDC talk on IK Rigs. With many game engines like Unity and Unreal developing their own IK Rig like systems, this project helps fill the void for web based engines like threejs, babylon, etc. Hopefully with enough help we can create something just as good as the big boys, maybe even better since its free & open source.

<br><img align='center' src=""https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQEAyhN1Srt_2g/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/0/1646282533489?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=6ajBcu44vaRavbj3df4kI4towfkjHJUqnKywxqP8WiE"" />

### Setup ###

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

**[ NOTE ]** To be able to run the example, you'll need to go into /examples/_res/ and follow the instructions to clone the resource repo. The files are quite large, so they are kept in a seperate repo to keep this project as light weight as possible.

## Usage ###

This example is the basic boiler plate example of how to pull mesh & skeletal data from a GLTF2 file then using a custom THREE.JS Material to render mesh that can be posed or animated.

```javascript
const gltf = await Gltf2.fetch( '../_res/models/nabba/nabba.gltf' );

//--------------------------------
// Setup Armature
const arm  = new Armature();
for( let j of gltf.getSkin().joints ){
    arm.addBone( j.name, j.parentIndex, j.rotation, j.position, j.scale );
}

//--------------------------------
// Setup Skinning : Matrix
arm.bind( SkinMTX, 0.07 ); 
const mat = SkinMTXMaterial( 'cyan', arm.getSkinOffsets()[0] ); 

//--------------------------------
// Load Mesh
const mesh  = Gltf2Util.loadMesh( gltf, null, mat );
App.add( mesh );
```
---
## Current Features ##
* Armature System built around 'Bones' instead of 'Joints'
* Several Skinning Plugins
  * `Matrices` : Typical Skinning, easiest to use in GLSL
  * `Dual Quaternions` : For better bending of vertices, typically used in places like Disney. It can only handle Rotation & Translation, scaling individual bones don't work.
  * `DQ Transform` : Experimental & unique to this library. It uses Transform instead of matrices or dualquats to handle the transformation hierarchy & bind pose. When the data is prepared for shader use the worldspace transform gets converted to Dual Quaternions to handle rotation & translation along with an extra buffer that contains scale. The hopes of this hybrid approach is to get the quality of DQ while still being able to scaled individual bones like when using matrix skinning.
* Bone Springs ( Rotation & Translation )
* Basic Animator based on Tracks
* Basic Animation Retargeting for similar skeletal meshes
* IK Rigs
  * Biped ( Human )
  * Quadruped *( Prototype Phase )*
* IK Animation Retargeting using IK Rigs
* IK Solvers
  * Aim / SwingTwist
  * SwingTwist - Ends
  * SwingTwist - Chain
  * Limb
  * Arc
  * ArcSin
  * Fabrik
  * Natural CCD
  * Piston
  * Spring 
  * Trapezoid
  * ZSolver
  * Catenary / Rope
* GLTF2 Asset Parsing for cherry picking what you need to load.
* A few examples using BabylonJS for rendering
* Several examples using ThreeJS for rendering
  * Some extra fun examples like converting animations to Data Textures
  * Running Full Skinned animation on the GPU with GLSL Example
  * Using Instancing & Data Texture to animate a collection of randomly placed & rotated meshes
* Ready Player Me Example : Parsing, TPose Generation & Auto IK Rigging
* Bone Slots : A way to programmically attach assets to bones
* IK Animation Additives


---

livekit/client-sdk-unity-web,C#,"# LiveKit Unity SDK
This package only works on the WebGL platform of Unity

## Docs
Docs and guides at https://docs.livekit.io

[SDK reference](https://livekit.github.io/client-sdk-unity-web/)

## Installation :
Follow this [unity tutorial](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) using the `https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity-web.git` link.
You can then directly import the samples into the package manager.

If you want to write JavaScript code in your application (e.g. you want to use React for your UI), you can install our [TypeScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@livekit/livekit-unity) via npm.
To avoid confusion, the npm package and the Unity package will always have the same version number.

## Usage : 
There are two different ways to build an application using this package :
1. Write your application entirely in C# (e.g. [ExampleRoom](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity-web/tree/main/Samples~/ExampleRoom))
2. Still use JS and be able to bridge the Room object by using our npm package. (e.g. [JSExample](https://github.com/livekit/client-sdk-unity-web/tree/main/Samples~/JSExample))

### Debugging
To display internal LiveKit logs, add LK DEBUG to define symbols

## Examples
For a complete example, look at our [demo](https://github.com/livekit/client-unity-demo)
### Connecting to a room
```cs
public class MyObject : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Room Room;

    IEnumerator Start()
    {
        Room = new Room();
        var c = Room.Connect(""<livekit-url>"", ""<your-token>"");
        yield return c;

        if (!c.IsError) {
            // Connected
        }
    }
}

```

### Publishing video & audio

```cs
yield return Room.LocalParticipant.EnableCameraAndMicrophone();
```

### Display a video on a RawImage
```cs
RawImage image = GetComponent<RawImage>();

Room.TrackSubscribed += (track, publication, participant) =>
{
    if(track.Kind == TrackKind.Video)
    {
        var video = track.Attach() as HTMLVideoElement;
        video.VideoReceived += tex =>
        {
            // VideoReceived is called every time the video resolution changes
            image.texture = tex;
        };
    }
};
```

### Sending/Receiving data
```cs
Room.DataReceived += (data, participant, kind) =>
{
    Debug.Log(""Received data : "" + Encoding.ASCII.GetString(data));
};

yield return Room.LocalParticipant.PublishData(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(""This is as test""), DataPacketKind.RELIABLE);
```

Micro is a cloud platform for API development.

## Overview

**A community fork and extension of [micro](https://github.com/micro/micro) with great hornor.**

Micro addresses the key requirements for building services in the cloud. It leverages the microservices architecture
pattern and provides a set of services which act as the building blocks of a platform. Micro deals with the complexity
of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build on.

## Getting Started

Find the cloud hosted services at [m3o.com](https://m3o.com)
Below are the core components that make up Micro.

**Server**

Micro is built as a microservices architecture and abstracts away the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. We compose
this as a single logical server to the user but decompose that into the various building block primitives that can be plugged
into any underlying system.

The server is composed of the following services.

- **API** - HTTP Gateway which dynamically maps http/json requests to RPC using path based resolution
- **Auth** - Authentication and authorization out of the box using jwt tokens and rule based access control.
- **Broker** - Ephemeral pubsub messaging for asynchronous communication and distributing notifications
- **Config** - Dynamic configuration and secrets management for service level config without the need to restart
- **Events** - Event streaming with ordered messaging, replay from offsets and persistent storage
- **Network** - Inter-service networking, isolation and routing plane for all internal request traffic
- **Proxy** - An identity aware proxy used for remote access and any external grpc request traffic
- **Runtime** - Service lifecycle and process management with support for source to running auto build
- **Registry** - Centralized service discovery and API endpoint explorer with feature rich metadata
- **Store** - Key-Value storage with TTL expiry and persistent crud to keep microservices stateless

**Framework**

Micro additionally now contains the incredibly popular Go Micro framework built in for service development.
The Go framework makes it drop dead simple to write your services without having to piece together lines and lines of boilerplate. Auto
configured and initialized by default, just import and get started quickly.

**Command Line**

Micro brings not only a rich architectural model but a command line experience tailored for that need. The command line interface includes
dynamic command mapping for all services running on the platform. Turns any service instantly into a CLI command along with flag parsing
for inputs. Includes support for multiple environments and namespaces, automatic refreshing of auth credentials, creating and running
services, status info and log streaming, plus much, much more.

**Environments**

Finally Micro bakes in the concept of `Environments` and multi-tenancy through `Namespaces`. Run your server locally for
development and in the cloud for staging and production, seamlessly switch between them using the CLI commands `micro env set [environment]`
and `micro user set [namespace]`.

## Install

**Framework**

Micro additionally contains a built in Go framework for service development.
The Go framework makes it drop dead simple to write your services without having to piece together lines and lines of boilerplate. Auto
configured and initialised by default, just import and get started quickly.

**Command Line**

dynamic command mapping for all services running on the platform. Turns any service instantly into a CLI command along with flag parsing
for inputs. Includes support for multiple environments and namespaces, automatic refreshing of auth credentials, creating and running

development and in the cloud for staging and production, seamlessly switch between them using the CLI commands `micro env set [environment]`
and `micro user set [namespace]`.

## Getting Started

Run the server locally(Recommended on Linux&Mac)

```
micro server
```

Set the environment to local (127.0.0.1:8081)

```
micro env set local
```

Login to the server

```
# user: admin pass: micro
micro login
```

Create a service

```sh
# generate a service (follow instructions in output)
micro new helloworld

# run the service
micro run helloworld

# check the status
micro status

# list running services
micro services

# call the service
micro helloworld --name=Alice

# curl via the api
curl -d '{""name"": ""Alice""}' http://localhost:8080/helloworld
```

## Example Service

Micro includes a Go framework for writing services wrapping gRPC for the core IDL and transport.

Define services in proto:

```proto
syntax = ""proto3"";

package helloworld;

service Helloworld {
 rpc Call(Request) returns (Response) {}
}

message Request {
 string name = 1;
}

message Response {
 string msg = 1;
}
```

Write them using Go:

=======

Install micro

```sh
go install github.com/micro-community/micro/v3@latest
```

Run the server

```sh
micro server
```

Login with the username 'admin' and password 'micro':

```sh
$ micro login
Enter username: admin
Enter password:
Successfully logged in.
```

See what's running:

```sh
$ micro services
api
auth
broker
config
events
network
proxy
registry
runtime
server
store
```

View in browser at localhost:8082

Run a service

```sh
micro run github.com/micro/services/helloworld
```

Now check the status of the running service

```sh
$ micro status
NAME  VERSION SOURCE     STATUS BUILD UPDATED METADATA
helloworld latest github.com/micro/services/helloworld running n/a 4s ago owner=admin, group=micro
```

We can also have a look at logs of the service to verify it's running.

```sh
$ micro logs helloworld
2020-10-06 17:52:21  file=service/service.go:195 level=info Starting [service] helloworld
2020-10-06 17:52:21  file=grpc/grpc.go:902 level=info Server [grpc] Listening on [::]:33975
2020-10-06 17:52:21  file=grpc/grpc.go:732 level=info Registry [service] Registering node: helloworld-67627b23-3336-4b92-a032-09d8d13ecf95
```

Call the service

```sh
$ micro helloworld call --name=Jane
{
 ""msg"": ""Hello Jane""
}
```

Curl it

```
curl ""http://localhost:8080/helloworld?name=John""
```

Write a client

```go
package main

import (
 ""context""
  
 ""github.com/micro-community/micro/v3/service""
 ""github.com/micro-community/micro/v3/service/logger""
 pb ""github.com/micro-community/services/helloworld/proto""
)

type Helloworld struct{}

// Call is a single request handler called via client.Call or the generated client code
func (h *Helloworld) Call(ctx context.Context, req *pb.Request, rsp *pb.Response) error {
 logger.Info(""Received Helloworld.Call request"")
 rsp.Msg = ""Hello "" + req.Name
 return nil
}

func main() {
 // Create service
 srv := service.New(
  service.Name(""helloworld""),
 )

 // Register Handler
 srv.Handle(new(Helloworld))

 // Run the service
 if err := srv.Run(); err != nil {
  logger.Fatal(err)
 }
}
```

Call with the client:

```go
import (
 ""context""
  
 ""github.com/micro-community/micro/v3/service/client""
 pb ""github.com/micro-community/services/helloworld/proto""
)

// create a new helloworld service client
helloworld := pb.NewHelloworldService(""helloworld"", client.DefaultClient) 

// call the endpoint Helloworld.Call
rsp, err := helloworld.Call(context.Background(), &pb.Request{Name: ""Alice""})
```

Curl it via the API

```
curl http://localhost:8080/helloworld?name=Alice
```

Hello world

```go
import (
 ""fmt""
 ""time""

 ""github.com/micro-community/micro/v3/service""
 proto ""github.com/micro-community/services/helloworld/proto""
)

func main() {
 // create and initialise a new service
 srv := service.New()

 // create the proto client for helloworld
 client := proto.NewHelloworldService(""helloworld"", srv.Client())

 // call an endpoint on the service
 rsp, err := client.Call(context.Background(), &proto.CallRequest{
  Name: ""John"",
 })
 if err != nil {
  fmt.Println(""Error calling helloworld: "", err)
  return
 }

 // print the response
 fmt.Println(""Response: "", rsp.Message)
 
 // let's delay the process for exiting for reasons you'll see below
 time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}
```

Run it

```
micro run .
```

# 📝 주제 선정 배경
- Arts in Metaverse(AiM)에 대해 간단히 설명드리자면, “메타버스 내에서 전시공간을 경험할 수 있도록 만들자”라는 생각에서 나온 서비스입니다. 코로나로 다수의 인원이 한 공간에서 만나는 것이 어려워졌고, 시공간적 제한이 많은 전시공간은 전시할 기회조차 많이 사라졌습니다. 위기를 기회로 많은 전시공간들이 웹 상에서 이루어지고 있는데, 그 변화에 발맞춰 메타버스 내에 전시공간을 만들고자 하였습니다.

## What is Radio Caca?

- Radio Caca is the exclusive manager of Maye Musk Mystery Box (MPB) NFT and governance token for The USM Metaverse.

- The USM is an MMO 3D Mapping Metaverse with the same style of Decentraland. However, we have a real 3D Planet where users can zoom in and zoom out dynamically inside and around the planet.  This feature is the first ever to be shown on the game market globally.

- Radio Caca launched <Metamon> on the BSC in October 2021. It’s a “Play To Earn” game where RACA plays the role of “AXS” in AXIE Infinity. Metamon game will be expanded into the Universal Metaverse later (USM).

# TON Fingerprints
This is a set of unique digital fingerprints created based on the algorithm for generating basic rings using a noise texture. Like human fingerprints, you can now use them for the Web 3.0 and metaverse era as digital biometric information on The Open Network.
## Histogram
## Owner list
If nft has owner address on presale stage - it will be minted with that owner, if not it will be minted with minter as owner.
List [here](nfts.csv)

Example:
```
0
1
2,EQCjNf6y_RhVATipbgKpCBAa8h5z6mwIXv3oDY7UZRyv0w3m
```
This will create 3 NFTs. NFTs with index `0` and `1` will be owned by you wallet, while NFT with index `2` will be owned by `EQCjNf6y_RhVATipbgKpCBAa8h5z6mwIXv3oDY7UZRyv0w3m`

## Algorithm for generating basic rings using a noise texture

```glsl
vec2 hash2( vec2 p )
{
    p = vec2( dot(p,vec2(63.31,127.63)), dot(p,vec2(395.467,213.799)) );
    return -1.0 + 2.0*fract(sin(p)*43141.59265);
}

void main(void)
{
    float invzoom = 64.;
    vec2 uv = invzoom*((gl_FragCoord.xy-0.5*resolution.xy)/resolution.x);
    float bounds = smoothstep(9.,10.,length(uv*vec2(0.74,0.55)));

    float a=0.;
    vec2 h = vec2(floor(7.*time), 0.);
    for(int i=0; i<50; i++){
        float s=sign(h.x);
        h = hash2(h)*vec2(15.,20.);
        a += s*atan(uv.x-h.x, uv.y-h.y);
    }
    
    uv += (3-5.).*abs(hash2(h));
    
    a+=atan(uv.y, uv.x);

    float w = 0.8;
    float p=(1.-bounds)*w; 
    float s = min(0.3,p);
    float l = length(uv)+0.319*a; 
    
    float m = mod(l,2.);
    float v = (1.-smoothstep(2.-s,2.,m))*smoothstep(p,p+s,m);
    
    glFragColor = vec4(v,v,v,1.);
}
```
### Variations
Every Fingerprint can be composed of up to 10 properties:

1. Count - Line counter
2. Area - %Area of fingerprint
3. Perimeter - The length of the outside boundary of the fingerprint
4. Ellipse Major - Primary axis of the fingerprint ellipse
5. Minor -  Secondary axis of the fingerprint ellipse
6. Angle - Angle is the angle between the primary axis and a line parallel to the X-axis of the fingerprint
7. Circularity - 4π ×[Area]/[Perimeter]² with a value of 1.0 indicating a perfect circle. As the value approaches 0.0, it indicates an increasingly elongated shape
8. Integrated density - The sum of the values of the pixels in the image fingerprint. This is equivalent to the product of Area and Mean Gray Value
9. Skewness - The third order moment about the mean
10. Kurtosis - The fourth order moment about the mean

> 메타버스와 NFT를 이용한 MZ세대 환경참여 독려 솔루션

솔루션 참여자는 제페토에서 탄소중립을 준수하는 친환경 활동을 경험. 체험 컨텐츠에 따라 포인트를 모을 수 있는데, 일정량 이상의 포인트를 확보하면 NFT 형태의 증표를 획득. 해당 증표는 자신의 아바타 및 프로필에 적용할 수 있음. 또한 포인트는 솔루션의 의사결정에 사용될 수 있어 탄소중립에 힘쓰는 참여자일수록 솔루션에서의 영향력을 크게 행사할 수 있음.

# System Overview

![](./images/Fig1.png)

- 블록체인 기술에 기반해 위변조할 수 없는 데이터로 신뢰할 수 있는 프로그램(스마트 컨트랙트) 수행이 가능.
- 스마트 컨트랙트로는 NFT증표 발행 및 관리를 위한 ‘NFT 컨트랙트’, 포인트 개념 구현을 위한 ‘토큰 컨트랙트’, 탈중앙화 환경에서 의사결정 및 집행을 위한 ‘DAO 컨트랙트’를 구현. 스마트 컨트랙트간 소통에는 제한이 없으므로 기능 확충이 용이함.
- 메타버스의 아이템 및 아바타, SNS 서비스의 프로필 등 NFT를 활용할 수 있는 서비스들과 스마트 컨트랙트를 연동. 스마트 컨트랙트의 연동에는 제한이 없으므로 추후 다른 서비스로의 확장이 용이함.

## Contracts

### 👩‍❤️‍👨 Rendezvous

- Propose new NFT.
- Claim NFT with enough rights, that is, governance tokens.
- Tagging whether NFT is used or not in real-world.

### 🏦 Giver

- Propose new mission.
- Claim governance tokens when you finish your mission.
- Deposit needed to prevent the abuse of tokens.

### 🎨 MMN

- ERC721 token.
- *It will soon be replaced by ERC1155.*

### 💵 vMMV

- ERC20 token.
- Provide some governance functionalities like voting, delegating, and so on.

### 💬 GovernorBravo Series & Timelock

- Governance for DAO.
- Forked from Compound protocol.

# User Scenario

![](./images/Fig2.png)

1. 사용자가 제페토에서 탄소중립을 준수하는 친환경 활동을 함.
2. ‘토큰 컨트랙트’를 통해 상응하는 양의 토큰이 발행됨. 토큰은 서비스 내에서 포인트와 같은 역할을 함.
3. 일정량 이상의 토큰을 보유한 사용자는 ‘NFT 컨트랙트’에 NFT증표 지급을 요청할 수 있음.
4. NFT증표를 지급받은 사용자는 해당 증표를 자신의 아바타 및 프로필에 적용할 수 있음. 사용자가 NFT증표를 소유했다는 사실은 블록체인에 담겨 위변조가 사실상 불가능함.
5. 토큰은 ‘DAO 컨트랙트’를 통해 거버넌스 참여에 활용할 수도 있음. 일정량 이상의 토큰을 보유한 사용자는 서비스 개선 안건을 제안할 수 있음. 각 사용자들은 자신이 보유한 토큰의 양에 따라 가중되는 투표에 참여할 수 있음.
6. 최종적으로 통과된 안건은 서비스에 반영되어 생태계를 개선. 가령 새로운 NFT증표의 추가, NFT증표 발행에 요구되는 토큰 개수 변경 등의 수행이 가능.

Metaverse-Football-League/mfl-smart-contracts,Cadence,"# Metaverse Football League

## Introduction

This repository contains the smart contracts and transactions that implement
the core functionality of the Metaverse Football League (MFL).

The smart contracts are written in Cadence designed for the Flow Blockchain.

## Directory Structure

The directories here are organized into contracts, scripts, tests and transactions.

- Contracts contain the source code for the MFL contracts that are deployed to Flow.

- Scripts contain read-only transactions to get information about
the state of the MFL ecosystem.

- Transactions contain the transactions that various admins and users can use
to perform actions in the smart contract like creating players, buying packs, ...

- Tests contain the unit test for the contracts, transactions and scripts.


## Contracts Overview

### MFLPlayer

`/contracts/players/MFLPlayer.cdc`

Contract defining the player's resource and the collection used to store players. The contract also contains a central
ledger where all the players' metadata are stored. Allowing MFL admins to update them easily.

### MFLPack

`/contracts/packs/MFLPack.cdc`

Contract specifying the resource for packs and the collection used to store them. Each pack is a unique resource that
can be burned to open it and receive the associated resources after the opening event is processed off-chain (see `/doc/openPack.md` for more details).

### MFLPackTemplate

`/contracts/packs/MFLPackTemplate.cdc`

Contract used to store pack templates. A pack template defines common characteristics shared between multiples packs:
- a unique ID
- a name for the packs
- an optional description of the packs
- maximum supply (nb of packs that can be minted)
- current supply (nb of packs currently minted)
- a flag indicating if packs' owners can open them or not
- image used for the packs
- a type (Base, Rare, Legendary,...)
- slots containing details of the probability of having a specific type of player.
### MFLAdmin

`/contracts/core/MFLAdmin.cdc`

Contract to access admin claims given by specific resources created for each contracts.

To be able to perform some admin transactions (mint players, mint packs,...), an account must have claims. These claims are given by the root admin. This one will set a private capability in an `AdminProxy` resource (which must be present in the storage of the account receiving the capability).

At any time the root admin can decide to remove a capability for a given account.



### MFLViews

`/contracts/views/MFLView.cdc`

Contract that defines different structures representing different data. This contract is designed to meet the expectations of the new Flow metadata standard which is based on a view logic. Each view represents a different type of metadata.

## Tests

Tests are written with jest and the Flow js testing library. Our goal is to have the best test coverage possible. We try to test every lines / statements written in our smart contracts.


## Dapper transactions

As we plan to use the Dapper Wallet, we need to whitelist some transactions that will be initiated by users from our Dapp.

These transactions are available here:

WebVR experimenting
I am trying to break down the walled garden VR. The plan is to create an in-browser browser for virtual reality experiences without the need for plugins.

Instead of having to jump in and out of experiments I will attempt to create virtual reality links in the form of portals.
Walking to a different room (or site) being as easy as walking through a doorway like you would in real life.

This all together with others.

Blend WebGL, WebRTC (data channels) and VR, and you get this.

paul-m/metaverse,PHP,"Metaverse brings Second Life and OpenSimulator to your drupal web site.

This software is woefully incomplete, and you should fix it. :-)

It is a very modularized module. (Say that three times fast.) It is glue that other modules use to get things done.

It has an IP whitelist system per grid, and allows you to turn off connections per grid. It's missing a lot of UI for this stuff, but you're smart.

It was written by Paul Mitchum, and is based heavily on the secondlife module by Khalid Baheyeldin. The parts that remain of Khalid's work are of course his own, and the parts that don't are copyright 2010 by Paul Mitchum.

The MediaPlay Metaverse

---

The plan is to use the Matrix protocol as well, but right now it's still nothing.
The version of Godot that this project uses might be a bit outdated, so right now it's impossible to request any web requests for now.

# Why [Matrix](https://matrix.org)?
Metaverses definitely need to be open-source, decentralized, federated, and interoperatable with other metaverses as well, so that's why it will use Matrix for most of the federation, interoperability, you know, the stuff that make metaverses work.

Though on how it works using the Matrix protocol, it's another story, the MediaPlay metaverse is focused on building the worlds for now.

# Matrix homeserver?
It's nice if we have some resources to set up our own Matrix homeserver, but for now it should work with a public Matrix homeserver. Just make an account and an unencrypted room and it'll work just fine. If you want end-to-end encryption (which isn't really practical for now, except for secret chats), you can use [Pantalaimon](https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon).

# Why use Godot for the client?
Some people used Godot as well to make simple games with the Matrix protocol, so why not?

# What platforms will it support?
Mostly the desktop (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux), but soon mobile (Android) as well.

# VR?
Soon enough, though it'll be available on mobile. (if you have a VR headset for phones like Google Cardboard, VR BOX, ...)

# Why can't I log in?
You could try using another Matrix homeserver for now, there will be an option to use a token soon (if you're using Element, you can find it in Settings -> Help & About -> Advanced -> Access Token).

Web 3.0 will definitely come soon. Not sure if the metaverse is (really) the future of the internet or is just a hype.

This repository contains the Lemonade Metaverse backend that drives the no. 1 creator marketplace in the metaverse.

### Overview

![Overview](docs/graph.png)

### Components

1. Backend: provides the HTTP server offering a GraphQL endpoint that allows clients to query for blockchain data and be notified of any changes.
2. Ingress: keeps the internal state, consisting of orders and tokens, in sync with what is happening on-chain.
3. Enrich: enriches tokens with the token URI, metadata, and royalties.

philippedax/vreng,C++,"WHAT IS VRENG ?
---------------
VREng (Virtual Reality Engine) is an interactive and distributed 3D application
allowing interactions in real-time between avatars and objects and navigation
in virtual worlds connected over the Internet.


REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------
You need the X-Window System (Xorg, X11R6 or Openwin).
Your visual must have a color depth of 8, 15, 16 or 24.

The following libraries are required: libjpeg, libungif, libXpm.
Other recommended libraries: libmysqlclient, libz, libpng.

Your machine and your network should support IP Multicast, mainly IGMPv2
and Multicast routing protocols to see other avatars in the same scene.
If is not the case a Unicast/Multicast Reflector is activated when vreng
is launched. VREng detects automatically if your host is on the MBone,
if true, VREng switches in Multicast mode, else continues in Unicast mode
with the Reflector.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------
	- Linux-*
	- MacOSX-10.*
	- Solaris*
	- Sunos4.1.*
	- HP-UX-B.10.20
	- FreeBsd[345].*
	- NetBsd*
	- CygWin32

VREng has not been ported on other platforms yet, but any port will be welcome.


DOWNLOADING
-----------
The VREng sources are available by:
  - Git:        git clone https://github.com/philippedax/vreng.git (recommanded)
  - Git:        git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/philippedax/vreng.git
  - Subversion: svn co http://www.vreng.enst.fr/svn/vreng/trunk vreng (no more active)
  - Tarball:    wget http://www.vreng.enst.fr/ftp/pub/vreng/vreng.tar.{gz,xz,bz2,zip} (no more active)


COMPILING
---------

If the script ""configure"" is not present, you need to build it first by:
	./autogen.sh

VREng uses an OpenGL library. The configure script will usually figure out
which one is installed on your system. There are basically two possibilities:
  1 - Your system already has a vendor OpenGL library installed.
  2 - If you want to use the Mesa free OpenGL emulation library (http://www.mesa3d.org/).

If your OpenGL library is not visible through the standard paths, you
can use the configure option: --with-GL-prefix=DIR.

VREng works with the Ubit toolkit.
Since vreng-7.0.0 the Ubit Toolkit is built in VReng by default.

Before compiling VREng check available features with:
	./configure --help

To compile VREng with defaults, type:
	./configure

and then
	make or gmake


INSTALLING
----------
The vreng binary executable and the vre script-shell
will be installed by default in /usr/local/bin.
To do this, type:
	make install
or
	make install-strip


HOW TO NAVIGATE ?
-----------------
You can alternatively use left button's mouse either arrow keys either
menu buttons to navigate in a virtual scene.
Arrow keys on your keyboard allow 6 spatial degrees of freedom:
	- key_up to go straight on
	- key_down to move back
	- key_right to turn on your right
	- key_left to turn on your left
	- key_pageup to look up
	- key_pagedown to look down
plus
	- key_home to look forward
	- key_end to accelerate
	- key_insert to rise up
	- key_delete to land on the ground

To identify objects, click on the left or right button of the mouse, the name
of the pointed object will appear, maybe with a pushdown menu containing buttons
to activate an action on this object (for example open/close for a door).


DOCUMENTATION
-------------
For more details, the documentation is available at

MediaPlay-Discord/metaverse,GDScript,"# metaverse [![Godot Export CI](https://github.com/MediaPlay-Discord/metaverse/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MediaPlay-Discord/metaverse/actions/workflows/main.yml)
The MediaPlay Metaverse

---

The plan is to use the Matrix protocol as well, but right now it's still nothing.
The version of Godot that this project uses might be a bit outdated, so right now it's impossible to request any web requests for now.

# Why [Matrix](https://matrix.org)?
Metaverses definitely need to be open-source, decentralized, federated, and interoperatable with other metaverses as well, so that's why it will use Matrix for most of the federation, interoperability, you know, the stuff that make metaverses work.

Though on how it works using the Matrix protocol, it's another story, the MediaPlay metaverse is focused on building the worlds for now.

# Matrix homeserver?
It's nice if we have some resources to set up our own Matrix homeserver, but for now it should work with a public Matrix homeserver. Just make an account and an unencrypted room and it'll work just fine. If you want end-to-end encryption (which isn't really practical for now, except for secret chats), you can use [Pantalaimon](https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon).

# Why use Godot for the client?
Some people used Godot as well to make simple games with the Matrix protocol, so why not?

# What platforms will it support?
Mostly the desktop (Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux), but soon mobile (Android) as well.

# VR?
Soon enough, though it'll be available on mobile. (if you have a VR headset for phones like Google Cardboard, VR BOX, ...)

# Why can't I log in?
You could try using another Matrix homeserver for now, there will be an option to use a token soon (if you're using Element, you can find it in Settings -> Help & About -> Advanced -> Access Token).

Web 3.0 will definitely come soon. Not sure if the metaverse is (really) the future of the internet or is just a hype.

# What is the ARMOD SDK

AR-MOD means to provide stable, flexible, convenient and fast AR technology empowerment for enterprises or individual developers with existing applications.
In addition, it is also possible to build a brand new AR application for enterprises or individuals that do not use the application. 

AR-MOD provides AR integration capabilities for enterprises or individuals. Users do not need to understand ARKit or ARCore or even rendering logic and information, but only need to focus on the realization of AR experience content.

> Real-time: every time you add content, you don't need to wait for review

![UILayer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82647748/149527960-32a8ea51-1c10-4085-9d75-8a0f2ce254fd.png)

In short, [ARMOD's](https://docs.phantomsxr.com/) solution is an AR experience platform solution similar to Snapchat ([Lens Studio](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/)) and Facebook ([SparkAR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/))! 

AR-MOD is a derivative framework based on Unity ARFoundation. MOD in AR-MOD means Modification in English, meaning: modification and module. This concept is widely used in games, corresponding to modifiable video games. Famous games such as Warcraft, Red Alert, Half-Life, CS, Victory Day and more! 

We transplant the MOD concept into AR technology to give users more freedom to create the AR creative interactive experience content they need! In this process, users do not need to worry about AR-SDK algorithm and code implementation, but only need to devote themselves to the production of AR creative interactive experience content. With only a small amount of code, you can use all the capabilities of AR-MOD on the APP to create greater commercial value.


# Enhance your world and applications

ARMOD is a powerful AR solution designed for artists and developers to build augmented reality experiences for hundreds of millions of Unity users. With its suite of Unity-compatible features, including custom shaders and advanced tracking technology, the possibilities are endless.

PROTOVERSE

Protoverse is a metaverse protocol. At a high level, protoverse is an
abstract virtual space. It is designed to be accessible and open to
everyone. It achieves this by describing the world abstractly like so:


    (room (shape rectangle)
          (condition ""clean"")
          (material ""gold"")
          (name ""Satoshi's Den"")
          (width 10) (depth 10) (height 100)
          (group
            (table (id welcome-desk)
                   (name ""welcome desk"")
                   (material ""marble"")
                   (condition ""new"")
                   (width 1) (depth 2) (height 1)
                   (light (name ""desk"")))

            (chair (id welcome-desk-chair)
                   (name ""fancy""))

            (light (location ceiling)
                   (name ""ceiling"")
                   (state off)
                   (shape circle))))


Since this is an abstract description, we can ""render"" it in many
different ways. For example, with natural language:

  $ ./protoverse parse example.space

  There is a(n) clean rectangular room made of gold named Satoshi's Den.
  It contains three objects: a welcome desk table, fancy chair and
  ceiling light.

This is important for accessibility. If we want the metaverse to be open
to everyone, we need some way to describe what is going on in this
abstract space without a visual rendering.

Another reason we prefer a high level description is that we want objects
in the metaverse to be friendly to our machine overlords. The metaverse
should be easily programmable with scripts and bots. A high level
description also allows us to reload the space quickly, while keeping
higher level-of-detail bits cached from previous loads.


PROGRAMMABILITY

The protoverse uses WebAssembly (WASM [1]) to enable computation for
clients interacting with the metaverse. WASM was originally devised as a
generic virtual machine for the web, but it is general enough to use for
cases beyond that.

With WASM you can use any programming language to code the metaverse.
protoverse comes with an embedded WASM interpreter that can execute WASM
code.  You will be able to augment clients to render your space in
greater detail, show HUD elements, create multiplayer games, etc.

You can already do a lot without client computation, for instance, your
space could be served dynamically, which you could periodically fetch to
get updated description of the room. This would be equivalent to ""refresh
the page"" on the web, except due to the level-of-detail nature of the
protoverse, you wouldn't need to refetch the entire room. The client
could cache models and other details that have been previously fetched.

The default, high-level description of the room could include position
information, so you will be able to see things that have moved when you
""refetch"" the state of the room. State updates like this could be a bit
jarring, so most likely you wouldn't want to reload the room for position
updates, these can be served via ""object state/position update"" network
messages.

What you do with these network messages could be handled automatically
for simple cases by the client, but otherwise could be handled by WASM
code served by the protoverse server.


THIS REPOSITORY

The goal of this source repository is the be the ""linux kernel"" of the
metaverse. Developers shouldn't have to deal with low level details of
the metaverse, in the same sense that linux application developers
shouldn't have to think about the details of TCP/IP when building their
applications.

This repository serves as the ""monorepo"" of the protoverse.

Goals:

* Zero dependencies. Ideally we will avoid linking to openssl as well.
  The metaverse should move on from certificate authorities if possible,
  opting for a trust-on-first-use model instead. Ideally we would use
  something like the noise protocol for securing communications. We can
  support this at the protocol level if it makes sense.

* Cross platform. We should try to support all platforms. Right now we're
  prototyping in linux, but the metaverse should be open and accesible to
  all platforms.

CryptoFrontier is the Full On-chained Game by FrontierDAO.

## Intdoruction

These days, the Crypto world is growing rapidly and we hear words such as DAO, GameFi and Metaverse more and more often.

I believe that Crypto is going to change the world and I have been working with crypto for several years now, mainly in the field of gaming.
However, I believe that Full On-chained Game is essential to realize the Metaverse. 

## What is Full On-chained Game?

As the Full On-chained suggests, this is a game where all the data of the game is stored on-chain.

This is a game where not only the characters and lands, but also the character’s status, skills, battle results and even the battle logic are recorded on-chain.

In current Crypto games, only the characters and lands are NFT, but the core logic of the game is off-chain.
The aim of the Full On-chained Game is to uproot that part of the game and make it on-chain.

## What is CryptoFrontier?

![CryptoFrontierField](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7692282/143732287-5b282105-2a8a-401c-b353-b9264e267ca7.png)

CryptoFrontier is the Full On-chained Game where you explore new frontiers and fight for supremacy.

Players develop their characters and explore new lands.
Alternatively, they can fight other players for their territories.

Battles will occur spontaneously in each region.
We do not expect to organize centralized tournaments.
This is the aim of Crypto Frontier, to be truly decentralized.

The results of the battle are recorded on-chain.
It is impossible to falsify your battle record and you cannot cheat.

## Roadmap

Q4 2021: Staking and Battle Beta

Q1 2022: Official Release

Q2 2022: Land

Q3 2022: Governance

## Project description

In this capstone project, I sought to leverage my new learnings of JavaScript,Typescript, and Angular FULL CRUD to build a study helper for my interests in the MetaVerse. Through this frontend production, this app serves as a to do tracker, resource log, and meta news hub for all things related to the meta verse.

Deploy Link:  https://jue-lan.github.io/metaVerseStudy-front/

## User Stories
- User can add items to their study to do list ~~and check them off as completed~~.
- User can view all tasks and resource ~~or sort tasks by category or resource type~~
- ~~User can edit and view a progress log on a task~~
- User can see a feed of current news related to things meta verse (external API)[almost...appears in console]

## Project Progression
Day 1    |Day 2 -Day 5    |Day 6    |Day 7    |Day 8    |Day 9
------------ |------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
|Mapped original ERD, started wireframe, mapped original project timeline | Backend work. Started some components mapping |Worked on connecting backend to front end | Sucessfully made a connection but rant into issues with recursive calling and no web page rendorings| Successfully rendered data onto page and not just console. Worked on trying to display object data correctly. Streamlined most of user stores and methods| Added some CSS styling

## Hurdles
#### Problem 1
Trying to to add a Login user portal. And overall getting mt front and backend to communicate.
- Solution: Dropping that initiative and refactoring code to meet deadline
#### Problem 2
Recusive calling of my data.
- Solution: Removing CRUD method from my ngInit
#### Problem 3
CORS ORIGIN issue. No 'access-control-allow-origin'. Cross domain request issue for half my method calls.
- Solution: I solved the issue with an extention download, but then I had an epiphany and realized it did add this to my other controller as well.
```
@CrossOrigin(origins = ""http://localhost:4200"")
```
#### Problem 4
Figuring out how to not display an object and then sorting out how to just display the values.
- Solution: Still working on it. Displaying the data format correctly and spending more time on my front end styling are my next steps for the future.

## PROTOCOLS AND DECENTRALIZED APPLICATION PLATFORM FOR THE NEXT GENERATION URBANISM 3.0
##### The intend of Urbanism 3.0 is to enable the development of better cities, and novel forms of urban Governance. Urbanism 3.0 does this by building the ultimate abstract foundational layer for cities comprised of protocols and applications, built on top of a programmable blockchain allowing anyone  to create their own arbitrary rules  for urban developments<br> Urbanism 3.0 introduces a fundamentally new class of cities that are connected to cryptoeconomic organisms — decentralized, entities that exist entirely in cyberspace, maintained by a combination of cryptography, economics, and social consensus.<br><br>
Ethereum, a blockchain computer that is fully programmable, has a unique property: It enables societies to write permanent code that has clear rules about how it will work in the future. That property has enabled the emergence of an independent field of knowledge and a space for innovation—The crypto-web3 domain.<br>
The integration of the crypto-web3 domain into the field of architecture and urbanism unlocks a completely new and innovative domain of projects and research, pushing the boundaries of these disciplines in new directions. 

The new crypto-urbanism domain make it possible to build novel models for cities on top of complex crypto protocol systems that in turn will affect the evolution of the city in a positive feedback loop. This is a novel design process that will allow us to invent and materialize novel forms for regional metropolisses based on collective ownership and decentralized cooperative networks. For the first time we can harness the transformational power of urbanization and scale up building private cities to become a powerhouse for growth, innovation and justice.

In this way, the domain of crypto-open internet—urbanism-[and architecture] become a platform for public and private interactions, with a new collective consciousness and a new form of decentralized democracy.<br><br> 
We are only just beginning to explore the potential of crypto[graphy], open-internet and urbanism. There are already many challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this socio-technical urbanism movement successful. These challenges include developing a collective vision for the city of the future, translating political and social philosophy into an ecosystem of internet protocols, among other issues<br><br>

There is an opportunity for a community-collective to champion the production of the first collectively-owned Autonomous City, and create a new era for cities. Building cities is the single most important act of production within society and as such is the entity through which nations most clearly express their global aspirations and generate economic opportunity. The new crypto-urbanism [protocol and decentralized application platform] uses public-community partnerships to unlock the potential of communities to fund and finance new cities from scratch. <br><br>

note: the term ""crypto"" is a shortcut to ""cryptographic blockchain technology""
  
## THE ZEROX DECENTRALIZED DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH LAB
#### URBANISM 3.0 WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE OF CITIES AND FORM THE METROPOLIS OF THE FUTURE
We are introducing a research lab to help bridge the technologies and ecosystem of Ethereum with the field of Urban Design and to help shape the domain of Urbanism 3.0 as an area of study and a framework to explore, invent and construct our collective future.<br><br>
Decentralised participation is at the heart of this project in which self-organised teams of international researchers come to the lab to collaborate on complex problems that necessitate progressive and shared ideas to construct our cities. <br><br>
This is a new type of lab that is organized as a collective on blockchain and functions as a platform allowing communities to pool their resources and collectively fund research for the cities of the future.
The lab operates as an open-source research hub with permissionless access for open public discussion and joint development enabling all relevant disciplines to come together and increase collaboration across the field.Its native token economy creates a decentralized market for talent that enables people anywhere to contribute to value creation in a truly meritocratic fashion.<br><br>
The lab is a work in progress that challenges the norms of how we conceive, build and live within our environment. The crypto-ubanism framework of research is comprised of three pillars
#### VISION
* DDRL will be the first lab to decentralise the process of creating a vision for the future of our cities. Details TBD.   
#### CITY FORMATION MODELS  
* Everything about design and growth models based on protocols 
#### PROTOCOLS  
* Urbanism 3.0 applications are standards specifying features or processes. They are based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).
* Oracles. TBD

## DECENTRALIZED APPLICATIONS
In general there are two types of applications on top of Urbanism 3.0 platform. The first category is protocols providing communities with more powerful ways of  managing and entering into public-community partnerships for building Autonomous cities and creating Special Economic Zones on blockchain. The second category is core protocols for developing novel forms of urbanism and governance of the commons.
### COLLECTIVE DEVELOPMENT: WEBUILD
Building private cities has traditionally been a centralized industry with a lot of friction at every step of the process. Projects are built by partnerships of nations, institutional investors, and very large contractors. while the role of the operating teams, architects, consultants etc. is to execute the ""vision of the client"" with citizens aas the consumers of the ""product""<br><br>
Urbanism 3.0 flip this model on its head. It enables a collective of people to jointly contribute to the development of a city backed by fractional ownership in the city's revenue streams. 
By introducing a Urbanism 3.0 we enable communities and local governance to take essential next steps to advance new private cities.
Urbanism 3.0 has the potential to draw citizens from around the world and reach new groups of people who are looking for a business community with shared social, cultural or economic goals.

### THE AUTONOMOUS REGIONAL METROPOLIS: CYBER-URBAN COMMONS 3.0  
The vision for cyber urban worlds: <br>
Urbanism 3.0 introduces the concept of cyber urban commons 3.0. A class of protocols to connect a public good to a community-owned and operated network that collectively decide on the allocation of resources. <br>
Cyber urban commons 3.0 are decentralized applications to enable the deployment of the institutional structure of autonomous urban commons, a hybrid model of cooperative organizations on the blockchain around public goods.<br>
The city use the novel commons 3.0 mechanism to assign the creation, governance maintenance, and renewal of commonly shared resources to protocols that run on the open internet for the citizens to access and participate.<br>

The cyber urban commons 3.0 are public goods [resources] that benefit humanity. Commons 3.0 They are new classes of assets that generate revenue for the city which is distributed to the shareholders, ""the citizens"".

The urban commons 3.0 solves the problem of governing resources used by many individuals in common where collective action can either preserve the commons or deplete it.


#### This is the Urbanism 3.0 version of a public goods cooperative:<br> 
think of a community of people that vote for the production of electricity from fusion reactors. The community would own the reactors and contribute to the joint development of the cooperative, rather than the current model - where the electricity is produced by large corporations for private profit. The benefits of the commons are distributed among the members of the community who contribute to the development of the cooperative.<br>

Any type of organization in the public services sector, urban infrastructure or a Common resources, such as a natural jabitats, can be organized as a crypto-cooperatives. City 3.0 is a decentralized network of cooperatives that manage the commons. City 3.0 is also a public good that is jointly owned and managed by citizens, delegators and cooperatives.

#### Urban Governance is dynamic and programmable. 
Urbanism 3.0 provides a variety of models for community governance as code blocks allowing anyone to compose their own arbitrary rules for ownership, voting procedures, or delegation of voting power. The coordination costs can be radically reduced in new types of decentralized networks, in which smart contracts enable participants to govern cooperatively.


#### Collective ownership: New classes of assets
Fractional ownership in public goods or a city is a new paradigm that is creating new types of asset classes [insert]in the physical and cyberspace. It is a new way of managing and developing the city's assets that includes public goods, utilities, and natural resources. This type of ownership allows for collective governance and management of these assets for the benefit of the city as a whole.

### CONNECTED CYBER URBAN WORLDS
In its final form the Urbanism 3.0 exposes a metaverse that becomes the interface to our physical urban and architectural environment. It is populated by avatar representations of real people that collectively own the cyber-urban space and the physical city.
The new  environment that enables cyber-to-urban interactions is where contemporary urban people create a new era of cyber-urban life in a way that unlocks the capacity of our societies to discover and implement new ideas and new rules

# Updated Code: https://github.com/metaegg/metaverse.git

This document describes the development and creation of the first Real Virtual World. Metaegg Metaverse will be a replica of the real universe. It will be developed using the best technologies available to overcome the current paradigm of the ""Metaverse"" and launch the user in a new era. What will be outlined is actually an idea, a project that we hope will soon become a reality. We believe it will be soon a reality, hoping that drawing a plot and describing what are the possibilities will encourage further progress and implementations.

Let's start from the correct definition of ""Metaegg Metaverse"": 3D  virtual environment of real-world around us created by the computer, shared with multiple users over the Internet with a persistent possibility of insertion, modification, and deletion of objects and agents and direct interaction through virtual devices. Furthermore programmable through a scripting language. 
The above definition only partially clarifies the possibilities offered by a Metaegg Metaverse. Here, then, is a brief ""manifesto"" that can detail more the characteristics of the Metaegg Metaverse project. 
A micro manifesto for the perfect ""Metaverse""**:**

* Immersive Virtual Reality: Immersive Virtual Reality, designed for a sense of ""presence"" and ""interaction"" at a high level. One should not think of a simple HMD viewer connected to an environment recreated on the computer, but of a platform that ""involves"" the user and above all gives him the possibility of interacting with other users, with objects, and also with automatic systems or systems guided by Artificial Intelligence.

* Open Source/Royalty Free protocols, standards, queues: the entire Metaverse source code should be released under Open Source lincense, but above all based on standards and non-proprietary protocols, open and certified by international bodies. Examples are the VRML standards and its evolution X3D which, however, after a period of good diffusion, have been ""forgotten"" by the IT industry. Recently, Carmack has also underlined this possibility with the creation of an open standard for describing a 3D scene and its transfer through the internet via glTF.

* Sandboxing User Generated contents In-World/Out-World: the ability to offer users tools for creating and editing any content within the virtualized environment is essential. The ability to import creations from other systems and software is also a goal that amplifies users' creativity and offers an unprecedented level of interaction. All current ""Metaverse"" offer this opportunity at various levels, which can then be specialized to create games, experiments and artistic forms of all kinds.

* Scripting system using software language as Javascript, C#, Go, Swift: directly correlated with the previous point is the need to program the entire environment through high-level languages. C#, Go and Swift seem to be perfect candidates even though the scene is currently dominated by Javascript. However, it is essential to give developers the option of creating links, automatically modifying the environment and interfacing it with other systems and platforms.

* Metaverse as protocol not only as API: it is quite obvious to think that the Metaverse exposes APIs, but it is even more important to assume and design a real protocol that allows different Metaverses to communicate with each other. . In the past, there have been several attempts such as MMOX, which has failed to overcome the draft state of the IETF.

* Crypto Currency inside Metaverse: Why not use Bitcoin or Ethereum directly? Despite many ads, still no Metaverse uses Crypto-currencies any kind to allow trade between users. This feature would instead make the platform unique and above all would involve the user more closely.

* Decentralized architectures: Almost all platforms for virtual worlds are based on classic client-server architecture. Moving to a peer-to-peer system would have enormous advantages. JanusVR, for example, allows you to use the incredible ipfs (Inter-Planetary File System) for the fast recovery of different assets.

Implementation of the Alfa version.

The software is currently only developed for Windows platform.

The current Client system is based on SW:

This repository contains a virtual reality ""escape room"" game written in C# using the Unity game engine. It is the chief data collection tool for a research study called ""MetaData,"" which aims to shed light on the unique privacy risks of virtual telepresence (""metaverse"") applications. While the game appears innocuous, it attempts to covertly harvest 25+ private data attributes about its player from a variety of sources within just a few minutes of gameplay.

_We appreciate the support of the National Science Foundation, the National Physical Science Consortium, the Fannie and John Hertz Foundation, and the Berkeley Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence._

## Getting Started
### Building/Installation
The entire repository (outermost folder) is a Unity project folder built for editor version 2021.3.1f1. It can be opened in Unity and built for a target platform of your choice. We have also provided a [pre-built executable](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/releases) for SteamVR on Windows (64-bit), which has been verified to work on the HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro 2, and Oculus Quest 2 using Oculus Link. If you decide to build the project yourself, make sure you add a ""Data"" folder to the output directory where the game can store collected telemetry.

### Running & Data Collection
Run `Metadata.exe` to launch the game. Approximately once every second, the game will output a .txt file containing the relevant observations from the last second of gameplay. At the end of the experiment, these files can be concatenated into a single data file to be used for later analysis: `cat *.txt > data.txt`.

### Controls
The following keyboard controls are available (intended for use by the researcher conducting the experiment):

`space`: teleport to next room<br>
`b`: teleport to previous room<br>
`r`: reset all rooms<br>
`p`: pop balloon (room #6)<br>
`u`: reveal letter (room #8)<br>
`m`: reveal letter (room #9)<br>
`c`: play sentence 1 (room #20)<br>
`v`: play sentence 2 (room #20)<br>

Many of these controls will make more sense in the context of the game overview. The data logging template included below under [data collection tools](#data-collection-tools) also includes these controls in the relevant locations.

## Game Overview
![game overview](Images/all-label.png)<br>
The above figure shows an overview of the escape room building and several of the rooms contained within it. Players move from room to room within the building, completing one or more puzzles to find a ""password"" before moving to the next room. Further details about each of the rooms are included below.

## Data Collection Tools
We have included in this repository the [data collection log template](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Docs/Metadata_Log.pdf) used by the experimenters to record gameplay observations. This can be digitized to produce a `log.csv` file for all participants (see [example](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Data/log.csv)). We have also included a [post-game survey](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Docs/Metadata_Survey.pdf) for collecting ground truth, which can be digitized to produce a `truth.csv` file for all participants (see [example](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Data/truth.csv)). To obtain user consent before the experiment, you are welcome to use our [IRB-cleared consent language](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Docs/Metadata_Consent.pdf). We additionally suggest the use of audio/video recordings which can be reviewed if necessary.

## Data Analysis Overview
<img src=""Images/method.png"" width=""350px"" /><br />
The above diagram summarizes the data sources and attributes we observe from collected data. Examples of data sources and corresponding attributes are included below:

### Geospatial Telemetry
#### Biometric Measurements
![geometry](Images/geometry.png)<br>
(E.g. Identifying height and wingspan from tracking telemetry)

#### Environmental Measurements
![room](Images/room.png)<br>
(E.g. Identifying room dimensions from tracking telemetry)

### Device
![locality](Images/device-hist.png)<br>
(E.g. Identifying device tracking and refresh rate)

### Network
![locality](Images/locality.png)<br>
(E.g. Identifying user location from server latency multilateration)

### Behavioral
![locality](Images/handedness.png)<br>
(E.g. Identifying handedness from observed interactions)

## Data Analysis Scripts
The [/Scripts](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/tree/main/Scripts) folder includes data collection and analysis scripts for a number of different primary and secondary attributes. The scripts require the `/Data` folder to include a sequentially numbered .txt file for each participant, a `log.csv` file with the observations for all participants, and a `truth.csv` file with the ground truth for all participants. Statistical results will be printed to the CLI, and generated figures will be stored in `/Figures`.

**Dependencies**<br>
The python 3 data analysis scripts depend on the following libraries:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- geopy

## Sample Data & Results
If you do not wish to run the experiment yourself to generate raw data, we have included sample data files for the PI ([1.txt](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Data/1.txt)) and co-PI ([2.txt](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Data/2.txt)) in the [/Data](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/tree/main/Data) directory, along with corresponding [log.csv](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Data/log.csv) and [truth.csv](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/blob/main/Data/truth.csv) files. The [/Figures](https://github.com/VCNinc/MetaData/tree/main/Figures) directory contains the outputs corresponding to this sample data.

## Overview

*Exokit Web* is a Javascript library for composing multiple WebXR applications in a regular web page. It works in all web browsers, VR and AR headsets, with no dependencies.

### index.html
```js
import 'https://web.exokit.org/ew.js';

xrEngine = document.createElement('xr-engine');
xrEngine.src = 'app.html';
```

### app.html
```js
// Create WebXR session
session = await navigator.xr.requestSession('immersive-vr');

// Add Mozilla Hub
fooFrame = document.createElement('xr-iframe');
fooFrame.src = 'https://hubs.mozilla.com/VxGmqjU/fuchsia-winding-room?vr_entry_type=vr_now';
session.layers.push(fooFrame);

// Add A-Painter too
barFrame = document.createElement('xr-iframe');
barFrame.src = 'https://aframe.io/a-painter';
session.layers.push(barFrame);
```

See [`index.html`](index.html) for a full example.

## Start example server

```
npm install
npm start
```

## How to use

Import `ew.js` into your app:

```html
<script type=module src=""https://web.exokit.org/ew.js""></script>
```

In the _top-level directory of your app_, create the file `sw.js` with these contents:

```js
importScripts('https://web.exokit.org/sw.js');
```

The [boilerplate code](https://github.com/exokitxr/exokit-web/blob/master/boilerplate/sw.js) has this set up already.

Finally, make sure you are serving your app over `https://` (or `localhost`), which is [required for Service Workers](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/#you_need_https).

And that's it! Read the [API Documentation](https://docs.exokit.org/).

- Render HTML to texture
- Cross-app messaging
- Automatic multiplayer with WebRTC
- Immersive Web Payments API

# 1. Introduction
ZERO is a multichain network, Multiverse + DAO for next generation videogames. It provides native asset-, finance-, governance protocols, Smart Contracts, a Metaverse Hypergraph, Decentralized Computation at its core. To provide cross economic interoperability between totally different ecosystems. Futhermore it will enable generative creation of games and game economies through algorithms, generators and provision of autonomous agents to drive transition of old economy videogames and creators into a tokenized and decentralized future.

- Native currency: $PLAY (EUR backed)
- on/off ramp currencies:  $KSM, $DOT, FIAT, others t.b.d.
- join our community: http://discord.gg/rhwtr7p

# 2. Economics

ZERO Token ($PLAY) features the following utilities, and the value of $PLAY token will accrue with the increased usage of the network and revenue from stability fees and liquidation penalties

	- Network utility and stability fees
		-- Asset, Finance and Governance protocols
		-- Payment
		-- Identity
		-- Computation
		-- Oracles
	- Governance: vote for/against risk parameters and network change proposals
	- Economic Capital: in case of liquidation/defaulting of contracts without sufficient collaterals

To enable cross-chain functionality, ZERO.IO will connect to the Polkadot Ecosystem ( starting with Kusama ) in one of three ways:

	- parathread —— pay-as-you-go connection to Polkadot
	- parachain —— permanent connection for a given period
	- bridge —— independent chain bridged to Polkadot

Becoming a parachain would be an ideal option to bootstrap ZERO Network, to maximize its benefits and to reach to other chains and applications on the Polkadot network.

To secure a parachain slot, ZERO Network will require supportive DOT/KSM holders to lock their DOT/KSM to bid for a slot collectively — a process known as the Initial Parachain Offering (IPO). $PLAY tokens will be offered as a reward for those who participated in the IPO, as compensation for their opportunity cost of staking DOT/KSM.

Currently in prototyping stage. PRs *extremely* welcome.

We are mainly focused on the user schema right now, although assets may be split off and worlds may also be considered in the future. The goal is to iterate pragmatically upon what exists and what we can wire up to virtual worlds today and not worry about more complicated use cases until we arrive at them.

# Meta iOS SDK

Render [Metaverse](https://gometa.io) experiences inside of your own app or framework. Build, test, and iterate with Metaverse Studio and Metaverse Browser, and then render in your own app.

[**Full Documentation**](https://gometa.github.io/meta-ios-sdk/Classes/Meta.html)

## Prerequisites

- Target iOS 9.3 or higher
- Create a Metaverse account and log in to [Metaverse Studio](https://studio.gometa.io)
- Install [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (this is a REQUIRED step!)

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is required to install Meta. Install Cocoapods with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Meta into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`. Note that you must include the GoMeta private spec repo in your Podfile to install Meta.

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
source 'https://github.com/GoMeta/meta-ios-pods'

platform :ios, '9.3'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Meta'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install --repo-update
```

## Configure App Privacy Settings

Metaverse experiences depend heavily on access to the Camera and device motion. Camera scenes that record video also require access to the microphone. Make sure your app's `Info.plist` file contains the following:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Use your camera to experience augmented reality</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Use your microphone to record audio</string>
<key>NSMotionUsageDescription</key>
<string>Use device motion to experience augmented reality</string>
```

## Initialize SDK

Before loading any experience, apps must initialize Meta by calling `Meta.configure(withKey: ""API_KEY"")`. This should be done once, ideally from within your Application Delegate's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method. You can find your API keys in Metaverse Studio on the [SDK Page](https://studio.gometa.io/sdk/keys).

```swift
import Meta
...

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    	// Initialize the Meta SDK
        Meta.configure(withKey: ""api-test-xxxxxxx"")

        return true
    }

}
```

## Present Experience

### Create an Experience object

Experiences are managed by `MetaExperience` objects. Initialize a new object with the experience ID, and optionally the delegate.

```swift
import Meta
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {

	var experience: MetaExperience!

	override func viewDidLoad() {
		super.viewDidLoad()

		self.experience = MetaExperience(id: ""EXPERIENCE_ID"")
	}
}
```

### Present the experience

Show the experience in response to a user action.

```swift
@IBAction func doSomething(_ sender: AnyObject) {
	Meta.shared.present(experience: self.experience)
}
```

### Use MetaExperienceDelegate (optional)

If you want to be notified when an experience closes (for example, to only reward a user if they have completed the entire experience), implement `MetaExperienceDelegate`. Be sure to set the delegate property on your `MetaExperience` object (`self.experience.delegate = self`).

```swift
extension ViewController: MetaExperienceDelegate {
	func metaExperienceDidClose(withReason reason: MetaExperienceCloseReason) {
        if(reason == .completion) {
            // Do something if the user completed the experience
        } else {
            // The user manually closed the experience
        }
    }
}
```

## Identifying Users

If you would like to store persistent user data, use `Meta.shared.identify(user: ""USER_ID"")` to associate your app user with the Meta SDK. Identifying users allows you to do things like save and track user properties across experiences, and to give and request items from users’ inventories.

You can identify a user using some unique piece of information known by your application. For instance, if your app requires accounts, you can invoke this method at the time of sign in and provide your user ID as the argument (or, if you require unique usernames, the username; or another piece of information like phone number or email address) to create a persistent Metaverse account linked to their user profile within your app.

This method only needs to be invoked once. It writes the user’s identification key to your app’s UserDefaults, and references it when loading subsequent experiences.

Note that, at this time, if you are unable to identify a user, or choose not to, all Metaverse activity within your app will appear to be coming from the account associated with your API key. This is fine for testing, but might lead to collisions and weird things when dealing with items and user properties in production. We recommend at least identifying a user with a randomly generated UUID.

## Submitting to the App Store

The Meta SDK collects the IDFA, if advertising tracking is enabled by the user, in order to aggregate analytics data and share impression data with our content partners (e.g., Google Poly, Gfycat Stickers, etc.). When you submit your app to the app store, be sure to check the following boxes under the ""Does this app use the Advertising Identifier (IDFA)?"""" section:

- ""Attribute this app installation to a previously served advertisement""
- ""Attribute an action taken within this app to a previously served advertisement""
- ""I, YOUR_NAME, confirm that this app, and any third party...""""

**Note, you should not check the box labeled “Serve advertisements within the app” unless you are actually going to display ads.**

## Common issues

**Scene backgrounds not loading**

If a scene background references an image, iOS will block loading of that image unless it is served from an https URL. To allow loading of insecure images in scene backgrounds, you need to make sure your `Info.plist` contains the following:

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

## Sample Apps

The `Demo` folder of this repository contains four sample apps. Watch the [preview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJdRIZD6N04) to see them in action.

- **SimpleDemo** shows how to launch an experience in response to a button press.
- **MetaNews** is a simple news reader that shows how display ads can render Metaverse experiences.
- **FlappyMeta** shows how Metaverse experiences can be used as Rewarded Interactive Ads inside of a game, requiring a user to complete an experience in order to keep playing.
- **MetaXCX** shows how apps can mix native content and embedded Metaverse experiences.

pocketzworld/highrise-contracts,Python,"# Highrise Contracts

## Introduction

- This repo contains contracts to support:
  - Highrise land and estates
  - Funding contract to run the sales on our webpage

## Contracts functionality

### Land and Estate

- `HighriseLand` and `HighriseEstate` contracts are ERC721 tokens representing parts of Highrise world that inherit following openzeppelin contracts:

  - ERC721Upgradeable
  - ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable
  - ERC721RoyaltyUpgradeable
  - AccessControlUpgradeable
  - Initializable

- Both of these are supported to work on OpenSea.

  - Owner of the contract for opensea is defined by `OWNER_ROLE` in access control.
  - Gas-less listing is supported by overriding `isApprovedForAll` method

- Estates can be constructed/deconstructed from/to land parcels. Supported shapes are 3x3, 6x6, 9x9 and 12x12
- To create estates from land parcels user must first approve estate contract for transferring. This is achieved by ERC721 `approve` function in `HighriseLand` contract and in custom batch approval function `approveForTransfer` function in `HighriseLandV2`
- Both Land and Estate contracts are intended to be upgradeable. This is done by using OpenZeppelin `TransparentUpgradeableProxy` to separate the proxy and implementation contracts. This provides us with flexibility to add new logic and storage variables to the contracts in the future.

#### Token IDs and Coordinates

- Land coordinates are in range (-250, 250)
- Token ID is generated on Highrise backend with the following logic:

```python
from struct import pack

def coordinates_to_token_id(coords: tuple[int, int]) -> int:
    """"""X and Y are 2 bytes each.""""""
    as_bytes = pack("">hh"", coords[0], coords[1])
    return int.from_bytes(as_bytes, ""big"")
```

- See https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html for more understanding.
- Estate contract has `token_id>coordinates` conversion function implemented. In that way estate contract can validate that parcels passed for estate creation have valid shape.
- Two tests are implemented to validate `token_id<>coordinates` conversion works:
  - `test_coordinates_parsing` - generates token id from coordinates in python and calls estate contract parse function. Compares that function returned coordinates match the ones initially used for `token_id` generation
  - `test_full_map_to_estates` - All land parcels in the map are merged into 3x3 estates
  - these tests are skipped when running `brownie test` due to long execution time

### Funding contract

- `HighriseLandFund` contract is a temporary contract used for sale purposes. It collects users payments and mints the Land tokens to the users.
- Contract States:
  - `ENABLED` - contract accepts payments and mints Land
  - `DISABLED` - contract does not accept payments, owner can enable the contract or withdraw funds
- Entrypoint to the contract from the user perspective is the `fund` function, which accepts a payload signed with a wallet key on our backend.
- When the payload signature is confirmed the payload is unpacked into `tokenId`, `expiry` and `cost` for minting purposes. After requirements are met Land NFT is minted to the user
- `FundLandEvent` is emitted when funding transaction is successful. Pending potential removal - not required anymore since we can track ERC721 `Transfer` events directly.
- Contract is granted `MINTER_ROLE` for `HighriseLand`

## Prerequisites

- Install `ganache` - https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/
- Install `brownie` (`pipx` is also required to install it)
  ```python
  # `pipx` install
  python3 -m pip install --user pipx
  python3 -m pipx ensurepath
  # install `brownie` with `pipx`
  pipx install eth-brownie
  ```
- Setup `.env` file and include the following variables
  - `DEV_ACCOUNT_NAME` - account stored in `brownie` used for deploying to testnets
  - `WEB3_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` - gateway to blockchain development - set up your account here https://infura.io/
  - `ETHERSCAN_TOKEN` - create account on https://etherscan.io/ - used for verifying and publishing smart contracts
  - `ENVIRONMENT_NAME` - Highrise environment that contracts will be used on

## Brownie commands

- `brownie init` - initializes the project and creates project structure
- `brownie compile` - compiles all contracts within `contracts/`
- `brownie run <script>` - runs custom python script
- `brownie test` - runs tests
- `brownie accounts list` - lists all stored accounts
- `brownie accounts new <account-name>` - import existing account via private key. Stored accounts are in encrypted JSON files known as `keystores`
- `brownie networks list` - list all available networks to connect
- `brownie networks add` - add new network

## Ethereum Theory

- Why to emit events
  - There are two types of Solidity event parameters: indexed and not indexed,
  - Events are used for return values from the transaction and as a cheap data storage,
  - Blockchain keeps event parameters in transaction logsEvents can be filtered by name and by contract address

GoMeta/meta-android-sdk,Kotlin,"# Module Metaverse SDK

![Meta Android SDK](logo.png?taw=true ""Meta Android SDK"")

Render [Metaverse](https://gometa.io) experiences inside of your own app or framework. Build, test,
and iterate with Metaverse Studio  and Metaverse Browser, and then render in your own app.

[**Full Documentation**](https://gometa.github.io/meta-android-sdk/io.gometa.sdk/-meta/index.html)

## Prerequisites

- Android API 19 or higher
- Create a Metaverse account and log in to [Metaverse Studio](https://studio.gometa.io)

## Gradle Setup

Add the GoMeta Maven repository to your root project's gradle.build:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        mavenCentral()
        google()
        maven { url 'http://maven2.gometa.io' }
    }
    // If using a -SNAPSHOT build include the following if you'd like to get new builds as soon as
    // they come out.
    configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy.cacheChangingModulesFor 0, 'seconds'
    }
}
```

In your app's module's gradle.build, include the following dependency:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.gometa.metaverse:storyboard-sdk:1.0.0-alpha3'
}
```

Alternatively, replace `-alpha3` with `-SNAPSHOT` to get the latest build (may be unstable).

## Proguard

When using proguard nothing special needs to be done directly due to this SDK, though our SDK does
depend on both `Guava` and and `okhttp3` for which the proguard rules (as far as we've been able to
test) are:
 
 ```proguard
# okhttp3 (https://github.com/square/okhttp#proguard)
-dontwarn okhttp3.**
-dontwarn okio.**
-dontwarn javax.annotation.**
-dontwarn org.conscrypt.**
# A resource is loaded with a relative path so the package of this class must be preserved.
-keepnames class okhttp3.internal.publicsuffix.PublicSuffixDatabase

# Guava
-dontwarn java.lang.ClassValue
-dontwarn afu.org.checkerframework.**
-dontwarn org.checkerframework.**
-dontwarn com.google.errorprone.annotations.**

# Metaverse SDK
-keep class io.gometa.sdk.internal.cloud.** { *; }
```

## Configure the SDK

To use the SDK we require an API key. You can find your API key in Metaverse Studio on the
[SDK Page](https://studio.gometa.io/sdk/keys). If any of the storyboards will show YouTube videos,
you'll also need to get a YouTube API key which you can do by
[Registering your app](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/register).

The easiest way to provide both keys in your `AndroidManifest.xml` like so:

```xml
<application>
    <meta-data android:name=""io.gometa.metaverse.sdk.API_KEY"" android:value=""my_api_key""/>
    <meta-data android:name=""io.gometa.metaverse.sdk.YOUTUBE_API_KEY"" android:value=""my_youtube_api_key""/>
</application>
```

## Load a storyboard's summary

The Metaverse SDK allows you to access your storyboard's summary details via an endpoint,
[Meta.loadStoryboardSummary](https://gometa.github.io/meta-android-sdk/io.gometa.sdk/-meta/load-storyboard-summary.html).
For this endpoint to work, [Meta.initialize](https://gometa.github.io/meta-android-sdk/io.gometa.sdk/-meta/initialize.html)
must be called prior. Normally this is done automatically when presenting a storyboard, but if your
app hasn't presented one yet you'll need to call the initialize method (usually in your app's
`Application` class' `onCreate` method). Note that you can also pass your API key via this endpoint,
passing `null` will default to searching for the API key in your application's manifest.

## Present a storyboard

Obtain an intent from `Meta.getStoryboardIntent(Context context, String storyboardId)` and launch it
as you would any other intent. If you'd like to receive a result from the storyboard, start the
intent with `Context.startActivityForResult(Intent,int)`.

## Get the result

If you've started the `StoryboardActivity` via `startActivityForResult` you'll get a call back to
your Activity or Fragment's `onActivityResult()`.
- If resultCode == `Activity.RESULT_OK` then the storyboard finished with either a completion or
suspend.
- If resultCode == `Activity.RESULT_CANCEL` then the storyboard finished with either the user
choosing to exit early (by either navigating back or selecting to exit from the menu) or the user
reporting the storyboard as broken/inappropriate.
 
 ### Get the close reason.
 
 In either case (`Activity.RESULT_OK` or `Activity.RESULT_CANCEL`) the `data` field of the result
 will be non-null. From the `data` Intent developers can obtain two pieces of information:
 - `data.getStringExtra(Meta.StoryboardResult.STORYBOARD_ID)` to get the storyboard's ID.
 - `data.getIntExtra(Meta.StoryboardResult.CLOSE_REASON)` to get the reason the storyboard ended.

## Identifying Users
If you would like to store persistent user data, use `Meta.identify(String userId)` to associate 
your app user with the Meta SDK. Identifying users allows you to do things like save and track user
properties across experiences, and to give and request items from users' inventories.

You can identify a user using some unique piece of information known by your application. For
instance, if your app requires accounts, you can invoke this method at the time of sign in and
provide your user ID as the argument (or, if you require unique usernames, the username; or another
piece of information like phone number or email address) to create a persistent MEtaverse account
linked to their user profile within your app.

You can also invoke this method with `null` to allow the Meta SDK to auto-generate a unique
identifier for the app instance. Note that this identifier will not be the same if the same user is
active across multiple devices.

This method only needs to be invoked once. It writes the user's identification key to your app's
shared preferences, and references it when loading subsequent storyboards.

Note that, at this time, if you are unable to identify a user, or choose not to, all Metaverse
activity within your app will appear to be coming from the account associated with your API key.
This is fine for testing, but might lead to collisions and weird things when dealing with items and
user properties in production. We recommend at least identifying a user by using the `null`
argument.

## Code

- Git

  We use the gitflow branch model

  - `master` is the main branch, which is also used to deploy the production environment. Cannot modify the code directly at any time.
  - `develop` is the development branch, always keep the latest code after completion and bug fixes.
  - `feature` is a new feature branch. When developing new features, use the `develop` branch as the basis, and create the corresponding `feature/xxx` branch according to the development characteristics.
  - `release` is the pre-launch branch. During the release test phase, the release branch code will be used as the benchmark test. When a set of features is developed, it will be merged into the develop branch first, and a release branch will be created when entering the test. If there is a bug that needs to be fixed during the testing process, it will be directly fixed and submitted by the developer in the release branch. When the test is completed, merge the release branch to the master and develop branches. At this time, the master is the latest code and is used to go online.
  - `hotfix` is the branch for repairing urgent problems on the line. Using the `master` branch as the baseline, create a `hotfix/xxx` branch. After the repair is completed, it needs to be merged into the `master` branch and the `develop` branch.

- Commit Message

  The submission message must begin with a short subject line, followed by an optional, more detailed explanatory text, which is separated from the abstract by a blank line.

- Pull Request

  The pull request must be as clear and detailed as possible, including all related issues. If the pull request is to close an issue, please use the Github keyword convention [close, fix, or resolve](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/). If the pull request only completes part of the problem, use the `connected` keyword. This helps our tool to correctly link the issue to the pull request.

- Code Style

  Use the `formatter_eclipse.xml` or `formatter_intellij.xml` of the `xdagj` code style in the `misc/code-style` folder.

- Code Review

  We value the quality and accuracy of the code. Therefore, we will review all the code that needs to be changed.

## FAQ

- Time Synchronization Method with NTP

  [XDAGJ_Time_Synchronization](./docs/XDAGJ_Time_Synchronization_en.md)

## Contribution

- Security Question

  XDAGJ is still in the process of large-scale development, which means that there may be problems with existing codes or protocols, or errors that may exist in practice. If you find a security problem, we hope you can give it back as soon as possible.

  If you find a problem that may affect the security of the deployed system, we hope that you can send the problem privately to xdagj@xdag.io. Please do not discuss it publicly!

  If the problem is a weakness of the agreement or does not affect the online system, it can be discussed publicly and posted to [issues](https://github.com/XDagger/xdagj.git).

- features

  We are very happy to add more useful and interesting new features to XDAGJ. You can talk about any interesting new features.

If you are interested in the development of XDAGJ, we also welcome you to join the developer team and contribute your strength to XDAGJ. You can get in touch with us at xdagj@xdag.io .

## Sponsorship

mscape/mscape,HTML,"# mscape.io - A Community-driven Metaverse Landscape

The metaverse landscape is a community-driven website that tracks metaverse projects and technologies. It gives an overview of the current state of the metaverse landscape, relevant projects and technologies and the key facts and information associated with them.
The metaverse landscape is structured along a 4-layer framework. It groups projects by their applications and technologies based on experiences, user capabilities and infrastructure. Each technology layer is split up into various capabilities. The framework will evolve over time as the space will evolve as well. The metaverse landscape is kept minimalistic and self-contained with just a few dependencies on purpose. The most recent version is always deployed to IPFS, a dencentralized storage network. You can reach latest versions here: [Landing page](https://mscape.io) and [landscape](https://landscape.mscape.io).

## Getting Started

We use `npm` in this project and commit the `package-lock.json` file.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Setup your environment with a `.env` file. See [intructions](#setup-environment).
3. Run command `npm run all`. See further [commands](#commands).

The metaverse landscape is now available at `build/index.html` and deployed to IPFS. You can open the IPFS version by using the CID (printed during deployment phase) and the IPFS gateway `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{YOUR_CID}`. Some browsers, like Brave, support IPFS natively with `ipfs://{YOUR_CID}`.

## Generating a landscape

Generating a landscape consists of two phases:
1. Build: Read the yaml data set, visualize it and generate (single) HTML landscape
2. (Local) Deployment: Deploy the generated HTML landscape and landing page to IPFS

## Setup environment

In the root folder create a `.env` file with the following content:

```ini
API_TOKEN={YOUR_WEB3_STORAGE_API_KEY}
```

Please refer to the [Web3.Storage documentation](https://docs.web3.storage/) for further information on how to obtain an API token. Production environment variables should be set in Github Actions secrets.

## Production deployment

The production deployment of the official mscape landscape and landing page currently uses [Fleek](https://fleek.co/) and Github Actions. Fleek handles the deployment of both websites to IPFS and additionally takes care of IPNS entries and TLS encryption. There are two configuration files located in the repository:
1. `landingpage.fleek.json`: Fleek configuration to deploy landing page
2. `landscape.fleek.json`: Fleek configuration to build and deploy landscape
  
Additionally, an environment variable `FLEEK_API_KEY` should be populated to Github secrets.

The npm `deploy` commands should only be used locally for test and development purposes.

## Project structure

The metaverse landscape repository consists of the following directories:
- `projects`: Consists of yaml data sets for projects
- `technologies`: Consists of yaml data sets for technologies
- `templates`: Consists of Velocity templates to generate static landscape website
- `logos`: Consists of logos for projects and technologies
- `landingpage`: Consists of HTML and assets for the landing page

## Commands

The metaverse landscape provides a set of commands:

- `npm run all`: Runs build and deployment
- `npm run start`: Runs watch server and rebuilds template on file changes
- `npm run build`: Runs build of lanscape
- `npm run cleanup:build`: Runs cleanup of build directory
- `npm run deploy`: Runs deployment of landscape and landingpage
- `npm run deploy:landscape`: Runs deployment of landscape only
- `npm run deploy:landingpage`: Runs deployment of landingpage only

## Contribute

The metaverse landscape is a community-driven open-source project which means everyone can contribute. There are two ways to contribute to the metaverse landscape:

1. Contribute by evolving the framework
2. Contribute by adding a new project or technology

### Contribute by evolving the framework

To contribute to the framework, please follow the instructions:

1. Change `framework/framework.yml` with your changes
2. Create a pull request with the respective commits

*Note:* Add additional rational and description to the pull request to ensure plausability of your changes.

### Contribute by adding a new project or technology

To contribute a new project or technology, please follow the instructions:

1. Decide for project or technology
2. Create a new data set in respective directory (`projects`/`technologies`) based on YAML examples
3. Add a logo
4. Create a pull request with the respective commits

#### Decide for project or technology

In the metaverse landscape, we distinguish between projects and technologies. Projects are metaverse experiences (e.g., games, 3D galleries, ...) that are built with the use of technologies. Technologies are supportive and enabling to projects. Technologies can be assigned to the capabilities listed by our framework. Feel free to explore the current version of the metaverse landscape to get a sense for projects and technologies.

#### Create a new data set

Create a new file `{name}.yml` in the respective folder `projects`/`technologies`. The filename must be in lowercase without any special characters or spaces and must be equal to the name of the project/technology.

Example project `decentraland.yml`:
```yaml
name: Decentraland
twitterHandle: decentraland
status: Live
website: https://decentraland.org
category: Open virtual world
metaverseNative: 0
threeD: 1
openWorld: 1
userContent: 1
access:
  - Web
token: N/A
description: Decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality platform powered by
  the Ethereum blockchain. Within the Decentraland platform, users can create,
  experience, and monetize their content and applications.
publish: 1
logo: logos/projects/decentraland.svg
```

Example technology `ipfs.yml`:
```yaml
name: IPFS
company: Protocol Labs
layer: Infrastructure
categories:
  - Fast geo-replicated caches
metaverseNative: 0
description: IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol developed by Protocol
  Labs. IPFS is decentralized and content-addressable. IPFS powers applications
  like Filecoin.
website: https://ipfs.io/
github: ipfs/go-ipfs
twitterHandle: IPFS
publish: 1
group: 0
logo: logos/technologies/ipfs.png
```

#### Add a logo

Add the logo in the respective logo folder `logos/projects`/`logos/technologies`. Filename should match the filename of the data set yaml file. SVG images with transparent background are preferred.

#### Create a new Pull Request 

Create a Pull Request with your commited changes. Your pull request message should start with `Contribution: {NAMES}` - NAMES can be a list of names. If you have multiple contributions, you can add them all in one pull request. We will review it and publish it as soon as possible.

### Conventions

Please follow the following conventions:
- Data sets must always be lowercase without any special characters or spaces with file suffix `.yml`
- Logos must be placed in logos/{project/technologies} directory
- Logo filenames must always be lowercase without any special characters or spaces and should be added to respective YAML file as a URL
- Logos should always be SVG images if available, otherwise use PNG with transparent background
- Twitter handles must not contain a #
- GitHub links must follow the structure `{ORGANIZATION}/{REPOSITORY}`

adheep/voxoland,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

MayaVerse is an experimental Metaverse - Immersive Virtual World

This document describes the development and creation of the first Immersive Virtual World. MayaVerse will be a fully immersive computer recreated universe. It will be developed using the best technologies available to overcome the current paradigm of the ""Immersive Virtual Worlds"" and launch the user in a new vision.
What will be outlined is actually an idea, a project that we hope will soon become a reality. We believe il will be soon a reality, hoping that drawing a plot and describing what are the possibilities will encourage further progress and implementations.

Let's start from the correct definition of ""MayaVerse"":
3D immersive virtual environment recreated by computer, shared with multiple users over the Internet with a persistent possibility of insertion , modification and deletion of objects and agents and direct interaction through virtual devices. Furthermore programmable through a scripting language.
The above definition only partially clarifies the possibilities offered by a Metaverse. Here, then, is a brief ""manifesto"" that can detail more the characteristics of the MayaVerse project.
A micro manifesto for the perfect ""Metaverse"":

* Immersive Virtual Reality: Immersive Virtual Reality, designed for a sense of ""presence"" and ""interaction"" at a high level. One should not think of a simple HMD viewer connected to an environment recreated on the computer, but of a platform that ""involves"" the user and above all gives him the possibility of interacting with other users, with objects and also with automatic systems or systems guided by Artificial Intelligence.

* Open Source/Royalty Free protocols, standards, queues: the entire Metaverse source code should be released under Open Source lincense, but above all based on standards and non-proprietary protocols, open and certified by international bodies. Examples are the VRML standards and its evolution X3D which, however, after a period of good diffusion, have been ""forgotten"" by the IT industry. Recently, Carmack has also underlined this possibility with the creation of an open standard for describing a 3D scene and its transfer through the internet via glTF.

* Sandboxing User Generated contents In-World/Out-World: the ability to offer users tools for creating and editing any content within the virtualized environment is essential. The ability to import creations from other systems and software is also a goal that amplifies users' creativity and offers an unprecedented level of interaction. All current ""Metaverse"" offer this opportunity at various levels, which can then be specialized to create games, experiments and artistic forms of all kinds.

* Scripting system using software language as Javascript, C#, Go, Swift: directly correlated with the previous point is the need to program the entire environment through high-level languages. C#, Go and Swift seem to be perfect candidates even though the scene is currently dominated by Javascript. However, it is essential to give developers the option of creating links, automatically modifying the environment and interfacing it with other systems and platforms.

* Metaverse as protocol not only as API: it is quite obvious to think that the Metaverse exposes APIs, but it is even more important to assume and design a real protocol that allows different Metaverses to communicate with each other. . In the past, there have been several attempts such as MMOX, which has failed to overcome the draft state of the IETF.

* Crypto Currency inside Metaverse: Why not use Bitcoin or Ethereum directly? Despite many ads, still no Metaverse uses Crypto-currencies any kind to allow trade between users. This feature would instead make the platform unique and above all would involve the user more closely.

* Decentralized architectures: Almost all platforms for virtual worlds are based on classic client-server architecture. Moving to a peer-to-peer system would have enormous advantages. JanusVR, for example, allows you to use the incredible ipfs (Inter-Planetary File System) for the fast recovery of different assets.

## Introduction

This repository serves as an example to build your digital twin with only a cellphone camera. The software at every step is either directly using open-source programs or written by me. I'll share the pipeline in depth in the following sections.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
  - OpenCV
  - Numpy
  - tqdm
- COLMAP
- nerf_pl
- Blender
- mediapipe

## Step 0 - Camera Localization

The first step of the pipeline is to calibrate your camera. This step is optional, but it would help the scale recovery and improve the localization stability in the COLMAP step. 

To calibrate the camera, please take ~50 images of a checkerboard pattern from different angles. The pattern would be printed out or displayed from any digital screen, eg. an iPad. Place the images under `camera_calibration/calibration_images`.

</p>

<figcaption align = ""center"">
  <b> Fig.2 - A sample calibration image </b>
</figcaption>



### Procedure
- Take ~50 images of a checkerboard pattern, and place those images under `image_preprocessing/calibration_images`
- Change line 8 (`CHECKERBOARD = (6,9)`) of `image_preprocessing/camera_calibration.py` if necessary
- `cd image_preprocessing`
- Run `python camera_calibration.py`
- Take 50 to 100 images of the target person with the same camera, and place those images under `image_preprocessing/data_orig/FOLDER_NAME`
  - Replace `FOLDER_NAME`
- Change line 20 (`w_h_ratio = 4/3`) of `image_preprocessing/undistort_new_images.py` if necessary
  - `w_h_ratio` is the image width height ratio
- Assign `w_new` and `h_new` at line 21 and 22 of `image_preprocessing/undistort_new_images.py`
  - Do this if the original image resolution is too high
  - This setting will affect both COLMAP and NeRF
- Change lines 46 and 102 of `image_preprocessing/undistort_new_images.py` if there're no less than 10000 images
- Run `python undistort_new_images.py`
  - `image_preprocessing/data/FOLDER_NAME` will be created, under which undistorted images and a `camera.txt` will be stored.

### Tips

- Keep camera scale and orientation fixed
- Keep the body of the target person as static as possible
- Take more than 70 images of the target person with full 360-degree views in an indoor environment
  - Eg. take images from at least 20 uniformly distributed angles and 3 images from each angle at different camera heights
  - An example is shown in Figure 3.
- Separate arms from the main body and legs from each other to reduce manual work in Blender
- If possible, make the background as simple as possible

### Further Comments:

- The photograph step is not automated at all, and it takes a couple of minutes. During that, there could be some minor body shifts, affecting the final mesh quality. In the future, I'm considering using a programmable cheap drone to automatically take pictures, but that extra hardware could cost at least $100. 
- Taking a quick video is another option. I haven't tried that yet.
- My pictures were taken outdoors, and I think that was a mistake and added tons of difficulties for NeRF to converge. That's why I'm suggesting having an indoor photography environment.
- Some AI algorithms could generate masks for the human body, and those masks could be used by NeRF, but I'm not sure if that would work well robustly. 

## Step 1 - Camera Localization

- Move `image_preprocessing/data_orig/FOLDER_NAME` to `1_camera_localization/`
- Create a subfolder `images` under `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME`, and move all images into `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME/images`
- Create a chain of subfolders `sparse/0` under `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME`
- Copy `1_camera_localization/sample_data_subfolder/sparse/0/project.ini` to `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME/sparse/0/project.ini`
  - Remember to change lines 4 and 5 of `project.ini` accordingly
    ```
    database_path=WORKSPACE_ABSOLUTE_PATH/1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME/database.db
    image_path=WORKSPACE_ABSOLUTE_PATH/1_camera_localization/images
    ```
  - And also line 14. The four values are `fx`, `fy`, `cx`, `cy`, i.e. `camera_matrix[0,0]`, `camera_matrix[1,1]`, `camera_matrix[0,2]`, `camera_matrix[1,2]`.
    ```
    camera_params=771.0800010279605,772.711181640625,241.53466279090742,354.9183215136509
    ```
- Run COLMAP GUI via `colmap gui`
  - Click `File -> Open project` and select `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME/sparse/0/project.ini`
  - Click `File -> Edit project`
    - Click `New` at the line of Database, navigate to `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME`, and create a file `database.db`
    - Click `Select` at the line of `Images`, and select `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME/images`
    - Click `Save`
  - Click `Processing -> Feature extraction`
    - Make sure that
      - The camera model is `PINHOLE`
      - `Shared for all images` and `Shared per sub-folder` are selected
      - `Parameters from EXIF` is unchecked
      - Values under `Custom parameters` is correct
    - Click `Extract`
  - Click `Processing -> Feature matching -> Run`
  - Click `Reconstruction -> Automatic reconstruction`
    - Assign `Workspace folder` to be `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME`
    - Assign `image folder` to be `1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME/images`
    - (Optional) Select `Extreme` for `Quality`
    - Check `Shared intrinsics` and `Sparse model`
    - Uncheck `Dense model`
    - Click `Run`
  - Sparse reconstruction result should be visualized, and please verify the camera poses visually
  - Quit COLMAP
- Change `scene_folder` at line 5 of `1_camera_localization/run_gen_poses.py` to `FOLDER_NAME`
- `cd 1_camera_localization` and `python run_gen_poses.py`

## Step 2 - NeRF Training

- `cd 2_NeRF_training`
- `git clone https://github.com/kwea123/nerf_pl.git`
- `cd nerf_pl`
- Execute the following command to train NeRF
  ```
  python train.py --dataset_name llff \
   --root_dir ../../1_camera_localization/FOLDER_NAME \
   --N_samples 512 \
   --N_importance 128 --img_wh 480 720 \
   --num_epochs 2 --batch_size 1024 \
   --optimizer adam --lr 5e-4 \
   --lr_scheduler steplr --decay_step 10 20 --decay_gamma 0.5 \
   --exp_name exp \
   --spheric \
   --use_disp
   ```
    - Remember to change `--img_wh 480 720` to be `--img_wh ${w_new} ${h_new}`. Replace ${w_new} and ${h_new} with their actual values.
    - Fine-tune `N_samples`, `N_importance`, `num_epochs`, and `batch_size` according to your GPU memory. The above example roughly consumes all GPU memory of an NVIDIA T4 GPU and takes about 1 day to converge at about 1.3 epochs.
- Use `https://github.com/kwea123/nerf_pl/blob/master/extract_mesh.ipynb` to extract a mesh within a certain 3D bounding box.
  - Note: I modified nerf_pl's `extract_color_mesh.py` slightly to reduce memory usage, and the modified file is under `2_NeRF_training`. Besides, I figured out that the 3D bounding box has to be a cube, rather than a cuboid. I also attempted to relieve that constraint but didn't succeed.

### Further Comments:

- Free free to try a faster version of NeRF, eg. `Instant-NGP`.
- We need a better meshing policy specially designed for NeRF or its variant to improve mesh quality and mesh exporting speed, as well as reduce the memory footprint. The current extraction method is indeed a brute-force one.

## Step 3 - Preprocess Mesh in Blender

- Open Blender
- `File -> Import -> Stanford (.ply)` to read the ply file generated in step 2
- Move the mesh bottom center to the origin. Rotate and scale the mesh properly if necessary
- Select the mesh, and in `Material Properties`, select `Base Color` to be `Vertex Color | Color` to see a colorful mesh
- At `Modifier Properties, add two modifier
  - `Smooth`, `Factor' = 1.000, and `Repeat` = 60 
  - `Decimate -> Collapse`, `Ratio' = 0.025
- Export the modified mesh to a new ply file
- Save and Create a new blender project
- Import the modified mesh
- Create a proper armature and parent the mesh to the armature
  - Take a look at the example at `3_preprocess_mesh_in_blender/Yukun512_7.blend`
- Assign weights to each pose bone in the armature
  - Still, please refer to `3_preprocess_mesh_in_blender/Yukun512_7.blend`


### Further Comments:

- Before smoothing, the mesh from the marching cubes has an unrealistically rough surface. Probably a better NeRF variant, eg. Neus, would provide a mesh with higher quality. And `Decimate` speeds up the subsequent processes.
- Blender is an amazingly capable 3D software. I still feel that I only know a little about it. Besides, it's a little bit hard to describe its usage with words, so many substeps are documented concisely here. 

## Step 4 - Mocap and Export

- Fetch your target video, extract images from each frame, and store them under `4_mocap_and_export/images`
- `cd 4_mocap_and_export` and `python mocap.py`
- `blender_data.json` will be generated

### Further Comments:
- There're some AI mocap websites, and I've tried two of them. The first one charged me $48 for a 5min video, and the exported motion was smooth but missed lots of gestures. And the second one was free, but I failed to use it. 
- Those websites could take 20min to process a 5min video, while mediapipe runs at 6~7 FPS. More importantly, with mediapipe, we could build real-time applications, rather than offline animations. 


## Step 5 - Mocap Data in Blender

- In `5_mocap_data_in_blender/script.py`, change the POSE_JSON_FILE_PATH to `$ABSOLUTE_WORKSPACE_PATH/4_mocap_and_export/blender_data.json`

```
POSE_JSON_FILE_PATH = NONE
POSE_OFFSET = 300
```
- Smooth the keyframes by switching the `Editor Type` to `Graph Editor`, andthen execute `key -> smooth key` twice.

### Further Comments:

- There're a lot of comments in the `script.py`. Please read them if you are willing to understand more about the ""ugly"" trade-offs and tricks in the code.
- There could be plenty of ways to improve the `script.py`, and in the demonstration video, you may notice some spurious behaviors, eg. sudden large body rotations.

## About the App:

Built using Moralis Vanilla JS boilerplate. The project is based heavily on **Bootstrap**, **Javascript**, and foremost 3D manipulating library **Three.js**. The models were modelled by me in **Blender**. 

After logging in with **Metamask**, the user  will be able to view a gallery of all of their NFTs.
The user can see their selected 2D NFT formed into a 3D model after clicking on it (*for now only available for some Bored Apes*).

The **Covalent** along with **NFTPort APIs** handle the data about each NFT, as well as their metadata with unique traits.


After clicking the minting button, the hot wallet message pops up. After accepting the transaction, the model is being converted to **JSON** format and NFT metadata is saved to **IPFS** storage.

## Neural Network

Before I thought of using Covalent API to retrieve traits, I trained a neural network in PyTorch to recognise Apes and retrieve their traits based just on their image. 

The data was scrapped using Covalent API and NFTPort API. 

orks with 99.99% accuracy, and all of the (not-so-clean) code is kept in the `AI` folder.

## Demo Installation Guide

<p>Create or open an <a href=""https://unity3d.com/"">Unity</a> project and import the NexPlayer™ Unity video streaming player plugin.</p>
<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/Step_0.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%"" alt=""Quickstart_Step_0"" align=""center""></img>

### Using NexPlayerSimple

NexPlayerSimple is a slimmed down version of our full-featured example player,
NexPlayer. You can use it by following this steps:

1. To add video playback to your scene, you will need to add a NexPlayerSimple
component to your scene:
   1. Navigate to the NexPlayer menu and click ""Create NexPlayer Simple
Object""
<br><p><img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/NexPlayerSimple/CreateNexPlayerSimple.png"" alt=""Create NexPlayer Simple
Object"" align=""center""></img></p>
   2. This will add a new GameObject (NexPlayerSimple) to your scene,
which will contain the NexPlayerSimple component along with the
NexPlayerRenderController component.
2. NexPlayersimple supports any of the three supported RenderModes
(RawImage, RenderTexture and Material Override). Using the inspector in the
NexPlayerRenderController component, select the desired Render Mode and
set the reference to that Render Object.
<br><p><img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/NexPlayerSimple/RenderModeSettings.png"" alt=""Render Mode settings"" align=""center""></img></p>

#### Example: Using Raw Image

1. Set the ""Starting Render Mode"" to Raw Image:
<br><p><img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/NexPlayerSimple/StartingRenderModeRI.png"" alt=""Starting Render Mode: Material Override"" align=""center""></img></p>
2. Create a Raw Image in your scene (GameObject → UI → Raw Image) and
drag and drop it onto the Raw Image field of the NexPlayerRenderController
component:
<br><p><img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/NexPlayerSimple/RenderModeSettingsRITarget.png"" alt=""Set the RawImage field"" align=""center""></img></p>
3. Start the scene and the video will play on the Raw Image.

#### Example: Using Material Override

1. Set the ""Starting Render Mode"" to Material Override:
<br><p><img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/NexPlayerSimple/StartingRenderModeMO.png"" alt=""Starting Render Mode: Raw Image"" align=""center""></img></p>
2. Create a cube in your scene (GameObject → 3D Object → Cube) and drag
and drop it onto the Material Override field of the NexPlayerRenderController
component:
<br><p><img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/NexPlayerSimple/RenderModeSettingsMOTarget.png"" alt=""Create NexPlayer Simple
Object"" align=""center""></img></p>
3. Start the scene and the video will play on the cube.

### Using NexPlayer

NexPlayer is our full-featured example player. You can use it by following this steps:

#### 1) Play Regular Video

<p>Create the NexPlayer_Manager GameObject by either using the NexPlayer Context Menu at the top or right clicking in the Hierarchy (Object Context Menu).</p>
<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/Step_01.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%"" alt=""Quickstart_Step_1"" align=""center""></img><br>


<p>Create the NexPlayer_UI GameObject using the NexPlayer™ Context Menu.</p>
<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/Step_02.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%"" alt=""Quickstart_Step_2"" align=""center""></img><br>


<p>Set NexPlayer_Manager references to the UI elements by clicking on the button ""Set UI References"".</p>
<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/Step_02_01.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%"" alt=""Quickstart_Step_2_1"" align=""center""></img><br>


<p>Create the NexPlayer Samples Controller GameObject using the NexPlayer™ Context Menu.</p>
<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/Step_03.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%"" alt=""Quickstart_Step_3"" align=""center""></img><br>


<p>Select any of the different samples provided by NexPlayer™.</p>
<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/Step_03_01.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%"" alt=""Quickstart_Step_3_1"" align=""center""></img><br>


<p>Finally, Change the NexPlayer™ component inside NexPlayer_Manager with the desired stream settings.</p>


#### 2) Play a 360 Scene

Select the value Nex Player 360 for the Active Sample setting at the Samples Controller GameObject.

![NexPlayer Video Streaming Player Plugin](resources/360_scene.gif)

#### 3) Load Any NexPlayer™ Sample Demo

Select any of the following samples as the Active Sample setting at the Samples Controller GameObject.

```cs
- Raw Image
- Render Texture
- Transparency
- Video Spread
- Material Override
- Multiple Renderers 
- Change Render Mode
- NexPlayer360
- Multistream Raw Image  
- Multistream Render Texture  
```

Add the Scene to the list and switch to the desired platform.

<img src=""resources/Scenes.png"" width=""60%"" height=""60%"">


### Platform Build Configuration

The NexPlayer™ Plugin for Unity provides the build configuration window to set the
build configuration for each platform in a fast and easy way.

Open the window by clicking in the top context menu NexPlayer/Build Configuration
Window.

<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/BuildConfigurationWindow/Window.png"" alt=""Build Configuration Window"" align=""center""></img>

The window automatically detects and informs of any conflicts regarding the build
configuration (graphics API, Internet settings...). The following messages will be shown if the build configuration is correct:

<img  src=""resources/unityimportinguide/BuildConfigurationWindow/Correct.png"" alt=""Build Configuration Window correct settings"" align=""center""></img>

The following warning will be displayed if the build configuration is not correctly configured. The button will change the configuration automatically:

# Wikipedia Metaverse Definition
A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection.[1][2][3] In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.[4][1]

The term ""metaverse"" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of ""meta"" and ""universe."" Various metaverses have been developed for popular use such as virtual world platforms like Second Life.[5] Some metaverse iterations involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies,[1] often including a significant interest in advancing virtual reality technology.[6][7][8]

The term has seen considerable use as a buzzword[4][9] for public relations purposes to exaggerate development progress for various related technologies and projects.[10] Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within metaverses, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.[11][4][12]

Implementations
Video games
Several components of metaverse technologies have already been developed within modern internet-enabled video games.[5] The 2003 virtual world platform Second Life is often described as the first metaverse,[13][14] as it incorporated many aspects of social media into a persistent three-dimensional world with the user represented as an avatar. Social functions are often an integral feature in many massively multiplayer online games. Technology journalist Clive Thompson has argued that the emergent, social-based gameplay of Minecraft represents an advanced analog of a metaverse.[15] Similar statements were made for the game Roblox,[16][17][18] which has since employed significant usage of the term in marketing.[19] Other claims of developing a metaverse include the games Active Worlds,[20] The Palace, and Fortnite.[21]

Virtual reality
In 2019, the social network company Facebook launched a social VR world called Facebook Horizon.[22] In 2021 Facebook was renamed ""Meta Platforms"" and its chairman Mark Zuckerberg[23] declared a company commitment to developing a metaverse.[24] Many of the virtual reality technologies advertised by Meta Platforms remains to be developed.[25][26][27] Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen criticised the move, adding that Meta Platforms' continued focus on growth-oriented projects is largely done to the detriment of ensuring safety on their platforms.[28] Meta Platforms has also faced user safety criticism regarding Horizon Worlds due to the occurrence of sexual harassment on the platform.[29][30]

Microsoft acquired the VR company AltspaceVR in 2017,[31] and has since implemented metaverse features such as virtual avatars and meetings held in virtual reality into Microsoft Teams.[32][33]

Proposed applications for metaverse technology include improving work productivity,[34][35] interactive learning environments,[11] e-commerce,[11] real estate[11] and fashion[36].

Technology
Hardware
Access points for metaverses include general-purpose computers and smartphones, in addition to augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, virtual reality (VR), and virtual world technologies.[7]

Dependence on VR technology has limited metaverse development and wide-scale adoption.[7] Limitations of portable hardware and the need to balance cost and design has caused a lack of high-quality graphics and mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets have struggled to achieve retina display pixel density needed for visual immersion,[37] while higher-performance models are wired and often bulky. Another issue for wide-scale adoption of the technology is cost, with consumer VR headsets ranging in price from $299 to $1099 as of 2021.[6]

Current hardware development is focused on overcoming limitations of VR headsets, sensors, and increasing immersion with haptic technology.[38]

Software
There has been no wide-scale adoption of a standardised technical specification for metaverse implementations, and existing implementations rely primarily on proprietary technology. Interoperability is a major concern in metaverse development, stemming from concerns about transparency and privacy.[39] There have been several virtual environment standardisation projects.[40][41][42][43]

In a January 2022 interview with Wired, Second Life creator Philip Rosedale described metaverses as a three-dimensional Internet that is populated with live people.[44]

Universal Scene Description is a specification for 3D computer graphics interchange created by Pixar and supported by Blender, Apple's Scenekit and Autodesk 3ds Max. The technology company NVIDIA announced in 2021 they would adopt USD for their metaverse development tools.[45]

OpenXR is an open standard for access to virtual and augmented reality devices and experiences. It has been adopted by Microsoft for HoloLens 2,[46] Meta Platforms for the Oculus Quest,[47] and Valve for SteamVR.[48]

Criticism and concerns
Privacy
Information privacy is an area of concern for metaverses because related companies will likely collect users' personal information through interactions and biometric data from wearable virtual reality devices.[49] Meta Platforms (previously Facebook) is planning on employing targeted advertising within their metaverse, raising further worries related to the spread of misinformation and loss of personal privacy.[4] In 2021 David Reid of Liverpool Hope University argued the amount of data collection in the metaverse would be greater then that on the internet stating ""If you think about the amount of data a company could collect on the World Wide Web right now, compared to what it could collect with the metaverse, there is just no comparison.""[50]

Addiction and problematic social media use
User addiction and problematic social media use is another concern. Internet addiction disorder, social media, and video game addiction can have mental and physical repercussions over a prolonged period of time, such as depression, anxiety, and various other harms related to having a sedentary lifestyle such as an increased risk for obesity and cardiovascular disease.[12] Experts are also concerned that metaverses could be used as an 'escape' from reality in a similar fashion to existing internet technologies.[49][51]

Metaverses may magnify the social impacts of online echo chambers and digitally alienating spaces[1][52] or abuse common social media engagement strategies to manipulate users with biased content.[52][53]

User Safety
Virtual crime like sex abuse and other user safety issues are significant challenges with current social virtual reality platforms, and may be similarly prevalent in a metaverse.[54][55]

Social Issues
In 2022, Keza MacDonald of The Guardian criticized the utopianism of technology companies who claim that a metaverse could be a reprieve from worker exploitation, prejudice, and discrimination. MacDonald stated that they would be more positive towards metaverse development if it was not dominated by ""companies and disaster capitalists trying to figure out a way to make more money as the real world’s resources are dwindling.""[56]

Fiction
Snow Crash, 1992
The term metaverse coined in Neal Stephenson's 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, where humans, as programmable avatars, interact with each other and software agents, in a three-dimensional virtual space that uses the metaphor of the real world.[57] Stephenson used the term to describe a virtual reality-based successor to the internet.[58]

Neal Stephenson's metaverse appears to its users as an urban environment developed along a 100-meter-wide road, called the Street, which spans the entire 65536 km (216 km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.[59]

Users of the metaverse access it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from grainy black and white public terminals in booths. The users experience it from a first-person perspective. Stephenson describes a sub-culture of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the metaverse; they are given the sobriquet ""gargoyles"" due to their grotesque appearance.[59]

Within the metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, ""to prevent people from walking around a mile high"". Transport within the metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 Express Ports, located evenly at 256 km intervals, and Local Ports, one kilometer apart.[59]

Ready Player One, 2011
Ready Player One is a dystopian science fiction franchise created by Ernest Cline which depicts a shared VR landscape called ""The OASIS"". The first novel was released in 2011, with a 2018 film adaptation, and second novel in 2020. The franchise depicts the year 2045 as being gripped by an energy crisis and global warming, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. The primary escape for people is a shared VR landscape called ""the OASIS"" which is accessed with a VR headset and wired gloves.[60] The OASIS functions both as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and as a virtual society.[better source needed]

Instead of having to jump in and out of experiments I will attempt to create virtual reality links in the form of portals.

mikezucc/metaverse-ipfs,JavaScript,"# metaverse-ipfs
Turn any [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) world into networked multiplayer using the power of p2p networking. The ultimate goal is to host all assets/js on CDN or on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and use p2p js libraries to distribute player metadata.

Simply put: a serverless internet where anybody can create virtual worlds accessible to the world.

**NOTE** Works 5% of the time if running on the same machine. I think this is a problem to do with IPFS PubSub library trying to network.

Currently this uses IPFS PubSub https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-pubsub-room-demo. I am compiling a version I did for this that is centralized architecture running on a central Node server and uses a central Socket.io server to distribute client data. I have found that IPFS PubSub, as I implement it in this example to date, is not designed for real time packet spam like I am creating.

Alternatives that I am considering: 
- Socket.io p2p https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-p2p

The clients sub/pub to rooms determined by the string of the last path slug in the current url.

## How to run:

1. `npm install` You may need some dependencies I don't remember for the IPFS security libs, but it should be apparent in install
2. `npm start`
3. Connect to http://localhost:12345 in two different browser windows. Usually this would be over an HTTPS connection so you have to allow non-secure connection
4. You should be able to see interactions visible in both windows

## UI:

- Pepe Frog button: indicates whether or not connected to PubNub WebRTC phone session. Used for VOIP
- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/): sometimes the JS takes a while to load in the objects and everything, so your player may fall through the ground plane. If that happens just refresh until it loads in time. I had to find an odd way of simulating gravity/ flying mechanic

Neal Stephenson's metaverse appears to its users as an urban environment developed along a 100-meter-wide road, called the Street, which spans the entire 65536 km (216 km) circumference of a featureless, black, perfectly spherical planet. The virtual real estate is owned by the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, a fictional part of the real Association for Computing Machinery, and is available to be bought and buildings developed thereupon.[59]

Users of the metaverse access it through personal terminals that project a high-quality virtual reality display onto goggles worn by the user, or from grainy black and white public terminals in booths. The users experience it from a first-person perspective. Stephenson describes a sub-culture of people choosing to remain continuously connected to the metaverse; they are given the sobriquet ""gargoyles"" due to their grotesque appearance.[59]

Within the metaverse, individual users appear as avatars of any form, with the sole restriction of height, ""to prevent people from walking around a mile high"". Transport within the metaverse is limited to analogs of reality by foot or vehicle, such as the monorail that runs the entire length of the Street, stopping at 256 Express Ports, located evenly at 256 km intervals, and Local Ports, one kilometer apart.[59]

Ready Player One, 2011
Ready Player One is a dystopian science fiction franchise created by Ernest Cline which depicts a shared VR landscape called ""The OASIS"". The first novel was released in 2011, with a 2018 film adaptation, and second novel in 2020. The franchise depicts the year 2045 as being gripped by an energy crisis and global warming, causing widespread social problems and economic stagnation. The primary escape for people is a shared VR landscape called ""the OASIS"" which is accessed with a VR headset and wired gloves.[60] The OASIS functions both as a massively multiplayer online role-playing game and as a virtual society.[better source needed]

hexcowboy/punk-loot,Solidity,"# CryptoPunk Loot Oracle

> The metaverse's first Loot Oracle, made for utilisation with [CryptoPunks](https://github.com/larvalabs/cryptopunks) by [LarvaLabs](https://www.larvalabs.com/) (_not affiliated_).

View the live beta proof-of-concept on Rinkeby testnet here: https://beta.loot.st/ (shut down -- host your own with this repo).

### Table of Contents

1. [Theory](#theory)
1. [Loot Oracles](#loot-oracles)
1. [Plain English (for non-developers)](#plain-english)

## Theory

Traditional NFTs are stored as numbers on the blockchain that corresponded to images on the internet. Loot takes the approach of storing NFT traits on a blockchain that can be interpreted by external applications in any way they choose.

It is important to note that **there will never be more items than already exist on CryptoPunks**, therefore should not impact the value or rarity of any Loot for CryptoPunks items. One CryptoPunk will always yield it's respective items.

With original CryptoPunks there are 10,000 NFTs. With Loot for CryptoPunks there are potentially 37,539 NFTs.

With original CryptoPunks, there are 10,000 combinations. With Loot for CryptoPunks, there are 185,569,280 possible combinations.

## Loot Oracles

CryptoPunk Loot aims to be the first step in defining a standard for Loot Oracles pertaining to `ERC721` and `ERC1155` NFTs.

The concept behind a Loot Oracle is as follows:

1. An original NFT exists on the blockchain but it's traits exist off the chain
2. The NFT is sent to an Oracle Contract that handles the reception of either ERC721 or ERC1155 tokens
3. The Oracle Contract emits an event, `ERC721Received` or `ERC1155Received`, that is listened for by an Oracle
4. The external Oracle uses it's logic to mint a new Loot item (or multiple Loot items)

### Contracts

- `Oracle.sol` is an `ERC721Receiver` or `ERC1155Receiver`
- `Loot.sol` is an `ERC721` or `ERC1155` token

**View the source code of the contracts in [contracts/](contracts/)**.

### Oracle

The external Oracle will act as an Ethereum event listener with the following requirements:

- The external Oracle **_must_** contain the private key for the Oracle operator address
- The logic **_must_** prevent against duplicate mints (1 original NFT = 1 Loot mint)
- If the Oracle has downtime, it **_must_** be able to resume missed transactions

**View the source code of the Oracle in [oracle/](oracle/)**.

## Plain English

To a non-developer, a Loot Oracle seems like a foreign concept. This section aims to break down what a Loot Oracle does in plain english.

The goal of a Loot Oracle is to take one NFT and break it down into many NFTs. For example, you may have an original CryptoPunk that is a Zombie, has a Beanie, Sunglasses, and an Earring. Right now you have _one_ NFT but in the end you would have _four_: Zombie Head, Beanie, Sunglasses, and Earring, all of which can be traded seperately. These new NFT's are known as ""**Loot**"".

The process is as follows:

First an original CryptoPunk is sent to the Oracle. Once the Oracle receives the CryptoPunk, it will trigger the blockchain to release a message saying that it received the CryptoPunk.

A server exists outside of the blockchain (called the external Oracle) that continuously listens for this message on the blockchain. Once it finds the message, it then mints the four new items to the same account that sent the original CryptoPunk.

After the Loot Oracle mints the new Loot NFTs, they are now freely tradeable on NFT marketplaces and will appear in your wallet.

Because the external Oracle needs to mint new items, the Oracle must be funded to cover gas fees. The Oracle fees are subject to change but will be a flat fee of some amount of Ether. At the project genesis, the price for the Oracle is `0.1 ETH` or `100000000000000000 wei`.

In most cases, a web application will walk you through this process. The classic example for this repository is [punk.loot.st](https://punk.loot.st/) which is open source in the [web-app](web-app/) folder.

Devansh-kajve/Samsara,JavaScript,"# Samsara

A Metaverse project where you can buy and trade land/properties and build upon them. Samsara literally means 'world' in sanskrit

I used three js to make a 3D world and then enabled buying land/properties in that world. The project does not solve any problem but I made it because it looked fun and I wanted to make something interesting and something which I am really passionate about, coincidently at the time I came to know about polygon fellowship 2022 and applied with this project.

## Technology Stack & tools used:

- Solidity (Writing Smart Contract)
- Javascript (React & Testing)
- Web3 (Blockchain Interaction)
- Truffle (Development Framework)
- Ganache (For Local Blockchain)
- MetaMask (Ethereum Wallet)
- ThreeJS (3D Javascript library)
- @react-three/fiber (React renderer for Three.js)
- @react-three/drei (Extra helpers for React-Three-Fiber)

Note: Use goerli network to access the plot and buying function and connect wallet

## Things left to improve:

- Improving the css all over the project
- Adding trade feature beside already implemented buying feature
- Day/night cycle based on system time
- Adding animated models to add some life to it

metaname-world/mns,JavaScript,"# MetaName

The MetaName Service (MNS) is the entrance to the Metaverse. like
company has a ""domain"", ""email"" or ""phone number"", Having a cool
name is a symbol of one's own identity, and also a symbol of one's
personal or company brand.

The main task of MNS is to establish the unique mapping between
characters and other data of people in the virtual world, and
people can control it themselves . For example, they can map the
""Averie.meta"" with the cryptocurrency address that is difficult to
remember, and the users only need to enter ""Averie.meta"" to send
money. They can also set links to e-mails, social accounts or
other data.

MNS is base on Polygon protocol which is building and connecting
Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. So, MNS is able to fully
benefit from Ethereum’s network effects, The advantage is users
can create there own names at a low cost ""zero gas"".

MNS is built to enable a future where MetaName are as widespread
and easy to use as domain and email address today.

# 📝 주제 선정 배경
- Arts in Metaverse(AiM)에 대해 간단히 설명드리자면, “메타버스 내에서 전시공간을 경험할 수 있도록 만들자”라는 생각에서 나온 서비스입니다. 코로나로 다수의 인원이 한 공간에서 만나는 것이 어려워졌고, 시공간적 제한이 많은 전시공간은 전시할 기회조차 많이 사라졌습니다. 위기를 기회로 많은 전시공간들이 웹 상에서 이루어지고 있는데, 그 변화에 발맞춰 메타버스 내에 전시공간을 만들고자 하였습니다.

<p align=""center"">
  <img src=""preview.png""/>
</p>

Displaying the winning stereoscopic cubemaps with A-Frame. Tested and working on Vive.

## Notes

Getting these to display properly took a bit of effort. The source images are easy enough to find on OTOY's site, but they are in ""double"" horizontal cubemap format (i.e. first six cube faces are left, second six are right). At least, I think they are (I could not find any official description of the format).

Since the [cubemap component](https://github.com/bryik/aframe-cubemap-component) only accepts six individual images, I had to break the source images up. Furthermore, each tile is horizontally flipped for some reason. I did not notice this until loading it up and seeing the stereo effect broken and text mirrored. There are probably clever ways of dealing with this, but I opted to go the simple route of manual processing with [Imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).

From the source file ""pano.png"", the command:

    magick convert pano.png -crop 12x1@ +repage +adjoin -flop pano_%d.png

crops the source into 12 equal pieces and 'flops' them (horizontal flip). At this point I made the mistake of renaming each file to match the scheme used by the cubemap component. I realize now that it would have been easier to change the cubemap component's scheme instead. Note that the first image in the set is the **negative-x** face (not the positive), the rest of each set is as expected.

The core mechanism in Lamdamoon Metaverse is **NTF Engineering** and its relationship with main fungible tokens ( LDM and LDDM ), which play important role in gameplay, in-game economic, play-to-earn incentives, and governance.

Before continue, please read about [story & gameplay](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/2264ecc193e04659adc9f3475e52ddf1) first.

This repo provides an overview of tokenomic, **NFT Engineering** and its implementation in Solidity.

Now we are going to discuss about 2 main fungible tokens : **LDM** and **LDDM**

For detail of NFT, please see [NFT Composition](docs/nft.md)

## Lamdanium - LDM

A new metal found on Lamda planet, which can be mined and has a lot of superior properties compare to titanium and vital for advanced equipment/weapon building. It is consumable and also main currency in the game.

You should read [PvE gameplay](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/Story-Gameplay-Reward-2264ecc193e04659adc9f3475e52ddf1) first to know more about reward mechanism.

**Default max supply : 200M**, this is the hard limit of LDM be mined on Lamda planet

**Full supply : 100M**

**Initial circulating supply : 21M**, from

- IDO - 8M
- Community Building - 8M
- Treasury - 5M

Circulating supply will heavily depend on amount of LDM earned in the game and consumed in NFT Engineering or burnt in Lamdanium Reactor for Lamda Dark Matter.

Reward in early stage will be taken from 10% of 100M tokens, then will be minted until reaching **Max supply**.

By design, maximum inflation rate should be between 15% - 20% annually, it should take 5 to 7 years to reach default max supply limit. As a result, LDM reward rate is controlled by governance and limited to not exceed inflation ceiling. The ultimate purpose is to maintain a balance between benefit of gamers and economy health of the game.

We all know that both hyper-inflation and hyper-deflation are not good for any economy, therefore max supply limit may be adjusted by governance in a distance future ( when the game jump to Chapter 4, which will explore other planets )

## Lamda Dark Matter - LDDM

A rare and mysterious substance discovered in alien artifacts on Lamda, which can be produced only by using [Lamdanium Reactor](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/Equipment-5c71927085e244239abd2b0240b11faa).

It allows human to build new tele-portals between Earth and any planet in Lamda Solar System. Anyone possess most LDDM will be able to control Lamda Solar System, hence it is governance token.

**Supply** : not available until the game running for a while.

LDDM is governance token, unlike other projects, the only way to mint new LDDM is by burning LDM. This mechanism helps to mitigate the issue of ""buying token for voting, then sell them"", it represpents commitment of parties in Lamdamoon governance.

_Just note that, in early stage, for smooth and fast development, governance is dev team itself, until coin-voting governance is enabled._

**How to obtain**

- Buy on market
- Burn a large amount of LDM in **Lamdanium Reactor**

**Utilities**

- Governance, _e.g. control treasury spending on public goods, vote on reward rate..._
- Essential for creating new tele-portals as well as special equipment/weapon NFTs
- Consumed in NFT Engineering process

yudus-labs/lamdamoon-metaverse,,"# Lamdamoon Metaverse

The core mechanism in Lamdamoon Metaverse is **NTF Engineering** and its relationship with main fungible tokens ( LDM and LDDM ), which play important role in gameplay, in-game economic, play-to-earn incentives, and governance.

Before continue, please read about [story & gameplay](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/2264ecc193e04659adc9f3475e52ddf1) first.

This repo provides an overview of tokenomic, **NFT Engineering** and its implementation in Solidity.

Now we are going to discuss about 2 main fungible tokens : **LDM** and **LDDM**

For detail of NFT, please see [NFT Composition](docs/nft.md)

## Lamdanium - LDM

A new metal found on Lamda planet, which can be mined and has a lot of superior properties compare to titanium and vital for advanced equipment/weapon building. It is consumable and also main currency in the game.

You should read [PvE gameplay](https://wiki.lamdamoon.xyz/Story-Gameplay-Reward-2264ecc193e04659adc9f3475e52ddf1) first to know more about reward mechanism.

**Default max supply : 200M**, this is the hard limit of LDM be mined on Lamda planet

**Full supply : 100M**

**Initial circulating supply : 21M**, from

- IDO - 8M
- Community Building - 8M
- Treasury - 5M

Circulating supply will heavily depend on amount of LDM earned in the game and consumed in NFT Engineering or burnt in Lamdanium Reactor for Lamda Dark Matter.

Reward in early stage will be taken from 10% of 100M tokens, then will be minted until reaching **Max supply**.

By design, maximum inflation rate should be between 15% - 20% annually, it should take 5 to 7 years to reach default max supply limit. As a result, LDM reward rate is controlled by governance and limited to not exceed inflation ceiling. The ultimate purpose is to maintain a balance between benefit of gamers and economy health of the game.

We all know that both hyper-inflation and hyper-deflation are not good for any economy, therefore max supply limit may be adjusted by governance in a distance future ( when the game jump to Chapter 4, which will explore other planets )

**How to obtain**

- Buy on market
- Rewarded in PvE by clearing a land plot on Lamda planet for the first time
- Stake **Mining machine** NFT items on Lamda land plots, majority of LDM will be earned in this way
- Winning and take from other players in PvP
- Rewarded in community events

**Utilities**

- Currency for NFT exchange
- Essential for infrastructure, equipment, and weapon NFT minting
- Burnt to produce **Lamda Dark Matter**

# Dmarket Cryptocurrency Tutorial

Dmarket Blockchain test version uses [Exonum](https://github.com/exonum/exonum) framework(v0.2).

## Prerequisites

To run this example you need to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/)
compiler and [third-party libraries](http://exonum.com/doc/get-started/install/).

## Build & Run

### Blockchain Node

To build and run a single node use:

```sh
# clone the repository with blockchain node
git clone git@github.com:suntechsoft/dmarket-blockchain.git
cd dmarket-blockchain

# build and run
cargo run
```

Now the node is listening HTTP requests on `localhost:8000`.

### Sample Transactions & Read Requests

When node is launched, you can use transaction examples to check that it works properly.
A simplest way to do this is launching the [`test.sh`](examples/test.sh)
script in the **examples** directory. This script creates two wallets, performs a transfer
among them, and then verifies that the wallet status was correctly updated.

Alternatively, you may use command-line utilities, such as `curl`, to manually POST transactions
on [the transaction endpoint](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/services/cryptocurrency/v1/wallets/transaction).

# Metaegg Metaverse
This document describes the development and creation of the first Real Virtual World. Metaegg Metaverse will be a replica of the real universe. It will be developed using the best technologies available to overcome the current paradigm of the ""Metaverse"" and launch the user in a new era. What will be outlined is actually an idea, a project that we hope will soon become a reality. We believe it will be soon a reality, hoping that drawing a plot and describing what are the possibilities will encourage further progress and implementations.

Let's start from the correct definition of ""Metaegg Metaverse"": 3D  virtual environment of real-world around us created by the computer, shared with multiple users over the Internet with a persistent possibility of insertion, modification, and deletion of objects and agents and direct interaction through virtual devices. Furthermore programmable through a scripting language. The above definition only partially clarifies the possibilities offered by a Metaegg Metaverse. Here, then, is a brief ""manifesto"" that can detail more the characteristics of the Metaegg Metaverse project. A micro manifesto for the perfect ""Metaverse""**:**

- Immersive Virtual Reality: Immersive Virtual Reality, designed for a sense of ""presence"" and ""interaction"" at a high level. One should not think of a simple HMD viewer connected to an environment recreated on the computer, but of a platform that ""involves"" the user and above all gives him the possibility of interacting with other users, with objects, and also with automatic systems or systems guided by Artificial Intelligence.

- Open Source/Royalty Free protocols, standards, queues: the entire Metaverse source code should be released under Open Source lincense, but above all based on standards and non-proprietary protocols, open and certified by international bodies. Examples are the VRML standards and its evolution X3D which, however, after a period of good diffusion, have been ""forgotten"" by the IT industry. Recently, Carmack has also underlined this possibility with the creation of an open standard for describing a 3D scene and its transfer through the internet via glTF.

- Sandboxing User Generated contents In-World/Out-World: the ability to offer users tools for creating and editing any content within the virtualized environment is essential. The ability to import creations from other systems and software is also a goal that amplifies users' creativity and offers an unprecedented level of interaction. All current ""Metaverse"" offer this opportunity at various levels, which can then be specialized to create games, experiments and artistic forms of all kinds.

- Scripting system using software language as Javascript, C#, Go, Swift: directly correlated with the previous point is the need to program the entire environment through high-level languages. C#, Go and Swift seem to be perfect candidates even though the scene is currently dominated by Javascript. However, it is essential to give developers the option of creating links, automatically modifying the environment and interfacing it with other systems and platforms.

- Metaverse as protocol not only as API: it is quite obvious to think that the Metaverse exposes APIs, but it is even more important to assume and design a real protocol that allows different Metaverses to communicate with each other. In the past, there have been several attempts such as MMOX, which has failed to overcome the draft state of the IETF.

- Crypto Currency inside Metaverse: Why not use Bitcoin or Ethereum directly? Despite many ads, still no Metaverse uses Crypto-currencies any kind to allow trade between users. This feature would instead make the platform unique and above all would involve the user more closely.

- Decentralized architectures: Almost all platforms for virtual worlds are based on classic client-server architecture. Moving to a peer-to-peer system would have enormous advantages. JanusVR, for example, allows you to use the incredible ipfs (Inter-Planetary File System) for the fast recovery of different assets.

- Implementation of the Alfa version The software is currently only developed for Windows/Mobile Apps platform. The current Client system is based on SW:

**3D Graphics Engine: Unity3D**

See list below

All server-side code relies on opensource services and software for Linux Server. The tests were carried out on the following HW VR:

**HTC Live 1.2
OculusRift CV1**

# MetaGraspNet Dataset V0

This repository contains the evaluation metric code for MetaGraspNet Dataset described in the paper ""MetaGraspNet: A Large-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Vision-driven Robotic Grasping via Physics-based Metaverse Synthesis"" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14663).

There has been increasing interest in smart factories powered by robotics systems to tackle repetitive, laborious tasks. One particular impactful yet challenging task in robotics-powered smart factory applications is robotic grasping: using robotic arms to grasp objects autonomously in different settings.
Robotic grasping requires a variety of computer vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation, grasp prediction, pick planning, etc. While significant progress has been made in leveraging of machine learning for robotic grasping, particularly with deep learning, a big challenge remains in the need for large-scale, high-quality RGBD datasets that cover a wide diversity of scenarios and permutations.
<p align=""center"">
  <img src="".github/500.png"" width=""500"">
</p>


To tackle this big, diverse data problem, we are inspired by the recent rise in the concept of metaverse, which has greatly closed the gap between virtual worlds and the physical world. In particular, metaverses allow us to create digital twins of real-world manufacturing scenarios and to virtually create different scenarios from which large volumes of data can be generated for training models. We present MetaGraspNet: a large-scale benchmark dataset for vision-driven robotic grasping via physics-based metaverse synthesis. The proposed dataset contains 100,000 images and 25 different object types, and is split into 5 difficulties to evaluate object detection and segmentation model performance in different grasping scenarios. We also propose a new layout-weighted performance metric alongside the dataset for evaluating object detection and segmentation performance in a manner that is more appropriate for robotic grasp applications compared to existing general-purpose performance metrics. This repository contains scripts for layout-weighted performance metric.

* Object completeness refers to if a single object instance is visually crosscut into multiple segments
due to occlusion.
<br/><br/>

The dataset (5 difficulties) can be accessed at:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/metagrasp/metagraspnetdifficulty1-easy
2. https://www.kaggle.com/metagrasp/metagraspnetdifficulty2-medium

4. https://www.kaggle.com/metagrasp/metagraspnetdifficulty4-hard2
5. https://www.kaggle.com/metagrasp/metagraspnetdifficulty5-very-hard

Additionally, we provide single class multiple instances scene dataset to address the data imbalance issue. Every class used in the above datasets are used in this dataset with variable amount of instances.

## Scripts
### metagraspnet_metric.py
Contains general metagraspnet evaluation script

<img src="".github/layers-figure.png"" width=""300"" > <img src="".github/layers-graph.png"" width=""400"" >

Our proposed metric focuses on evaluating top
and secondary layer objects. This is driven by the fact that in real-life practical scenarios, top and secondary layer objects have a priority to be picked, while picking the rest of objects requires moving away top and secondary layer objects. Besides evaluating model performance for top and secondary objects separately, we propose a layout-weighted metric which considers the model performance on both
top and secondary layer objects. More details can be found at: [paper link]

phantom-software-AZ/v3d-web,TypeScript,"# v3d-web

Single camera motion capture/humanoid rigging in browser.

## Objectives

v3d-web is a project aiming to bridge the gap between our reality and the virtual world. With the power of latest XR and web technologies, you can render and rig your favorite 3D humanoid avatars right inside your browser. Try it out now!

## Features

- Contains a complete solution from image capturing to model rendering, all inside browsers.
- Thanks to the latest machine learning technologies, we can achieve a fairly accurate facial and pose estimation from a single camera video stream.
- It also comes with a complete WebGL rendering engine, in which VRM models can be present with highly complicated backgrounds. VRM model rendering is done with [v3d-core](https://github.com/phantom-software-AZ/v3d-core).
- There is a [demo site](https://www.phantom-dev.com) showing how this project can be seamlessly embedded into a modern UI framework like React.js.

## Usage

### Install from NPM

```s
npm install v3d-web
```

### In browser

*Only latest FireFox, Chrome/Chromium, Edge and Safari are supported. WebGL and WebAssembly are necessary for this project to work correctly.*

In the simplest case, all you need is:
```s
const vrmFile = 'testfile.vrm';
try {
    this.v3DWeb = new V3DWeb(vrmFile);
} catch (e: any) {
    console.error(e);
}
```

You will need HTML elements with certain `id`s. See [index.html](test/index.html).

A more complicated example can be found at the [repo for our demo site](https://github.com/phantom-software-AZ/v3d-web-demo).

Hello, all EPKers! 
This project aims to reduce the costs of developing metaverse games in Ethereum / BSC with EPK token.

## Our Goals

We hope all game developers in EpiK Protocol ecosystem can focus on the game design and implementation without spending a lot of time to learn how to write smart contract and spending a lot of money to audit these general codes.

As for a game developer, you can use our sdk to deploy all general smart contracts within 5 minutes. These smart contracts will allow your users to

1. buy NFT blind boxes with USDT or EPK
2. open NFT blind boxes to get all kinds of NFTs in your games
3. stake their NFTs to earn EPK in the reward pool in your games

Moreover, these smart contracts provide the ability for you to configure the parameters and customize the rule about how to distribute rewards in your NFT staking pool. If you have a good idea about this sdk, please submit it as [the issue](https://github.com/EpiK-Protocol/epik-metaverse-sdk/issues) in this repo using the title with the prefix [ADVICE].

## About

API (application programming interface) definitions for metaverse capabilities in the wood platform. The Platform Metaverse APIs define a standard way of any metaverse integration, standardization into the wodo platform. Any developer can implement and plug any metaverse integration as metaverse engine implementations. Out of the box, the wodo platform has a variety of metaverse integration implementations. The API implementations also adhere to the industry standards, Once metaverse engines are implemented and integrated into the wodo platform, all functionality and capabilities are made available to the public world (developers, game developers, 3rd party companies) via public APIs of the wodo platform

## Publish The Module as NPM Package Locally

You may need to publish npm packages from your local dev env in order to speed up development process. It is sort of workaround and you should do clean-up your published package versions. Official github actions will take care of package publishing eventually.

Please follow the steps below to publish wp-metaverse-api npm package from your local development environment.

```bash
npm login --scope=@wodo-platform --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

in your terminal and you’ll be prompted to provide the following. Enter your github username, access token and wodo-platform email:

```bash
Username: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
Password: YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
Email (this IS public): wodo-platform@users.noreply.github.com
```

Once you log in successfully, you will see the messafe below:

```bash
Logged in as your_git_user to scope @wodo-platform on https://npm.pkg.github.com/.
```
Publish the package:

```bash
npm publish
```

Verif that wp-metaverse-api package has been published successfully with the correct version you provided in package.json file. Go to the page below and make sure that your packge is listed on the  published artifact list

```
https://github.com/orgs/wodo-platform/packages
```

> You should increase version number when you need to re-publish a new package version.

Once the package is published, you can add it to the dependencies list in package.json file. In order to retrieve the dependency, you must run **""npm login --scope=@Ywodo-platform --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
""** command at least once in your command prompt.

```
""dependencies"": {
        ""@wodo-platform/wp-metaverse-api"": ""1.0.0"",

  }
```

More details can be found on <a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry""> this page </a>

##  Adding wp-metaverse-api dependency

To be able to add wp-metaverse-api as npm dependency, you need to authenticate to git remote npm package repository by logging in to npm, use the npm login command, replacing USERNAME with your GitHub username, TOKEN with your personal access token, and PUBLIC-EMAIL-ADDRESS with your email address.

If GitHub Packages is not your default package registry for using npm and you want to use the npm audit command, we recommend you use the --scope flag with the owner of the package when you authenticate to GitHub Packages.

```bash
$ npm login --scope=@wodo-platform --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com --u your_git_user --p your_token 
```

Once you login successfully, you can run ""npm install"" command and start to develop your features. 

To run the same steps in the gitflow actions we need to create a secret in org level and set a personal access token as secret value so that when we run a repository, it can reach npn package regidtery of another private repository. GITHUB_TOKEN is generated by the gitflows per repository. It can not access to other private repos. We have WODO_TOKEN storing Serhat's personal access token as value today. TODO: It will be fixed later. 

Granting additional permissions
If you need a token that requires permissions that aren't available in the GITHUB_TOKEN, you can create a personal access token and set it as a secret in your repository:

Use or create a token with the appropriate permissions for that repository. For more information, see ""Creating a personal access token.""
Add the token as a secret in your workflow's repository, and refer to it using the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax. For more information, see ""Creating and using encrypted secrets.""

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow



## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```


## CI and Github Workflows

In order to build and package your repo through CI/CD, please have a a look at the file .github/workflows/pipeline.yml under the root project folder. It is preconfigured githubflow. Whenever you push a change onto the main branch, it is triggered. It will be improved to be able to package and release artifacts based on a release process later.

## Next Steps

Once you compose your new repo, you can create helm charts in wodo-helm-charts repo then conitinue with local deployment and official CI/CD gitops deployment. Please refer to Wodo Platform Local Dev Environment guide.

A bunch of sample contracts and scripts that can be used as inspiration to build on top of services we provide.

<h3>Repository Structure</h3>
This repo is structured like a truffle project. 
Here is a list of what each folder contains:
<ul>
<li>contracts/ : Actual Solidity code.</li>
<li>build/ : .json artifacts for all the contracts that this repo needs.</li>
<li>migrations/ : Deployment scripts for the contracts.</li>
<li>scripts/ : scripts for programatically interacting with contracts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

Other than truffle we the repo makes use of these packages:<br>
<ul>
<li>@chainlink/contracts</li>
<li>@openzeppelin/contracts</li>
</ul>
To install them go to the root and type:

<code> npm install @chainlink/contracts </code>

<code> npm install @openzeppelin/contracts </code>

<h3>Guide for new developers</h3>
<ol>
<li>Copy the contract code from the contracts/ folder.</li>
<li>Paste the contract in a new file in remix workspace.</li>
<li>compile the file with the specified compiler version.</li>
<li>Select injected web3 to interact with the chain specified in your metamask.</li>
<li>deploy the contract anew or paste an address and load it there.</li>
</ol>

**명품, 대기업의 NFT 도입**

이미 대형 브랜드들은 본인들만의 블록체인 컨소시엄을 설립해서 운영 중이거나 기술을 도입했다.

- LVMH + Cartier + Prada ⇒ Aura 설립
    - 중고거래 시장의 허위 매물 걸러내기 가능
    - 현재 위조품 걸러내기에 막대한 돈을 들이는 명품업계에서는 NFT 가 좋은 해결책
    - 각 제품마다 식별코드/QR코드를 내장하여, 카메라로 인식하여 정품인지 식별 가능
    - 또한 소비자들에게 생산과정을 투명하게 공개하는데 사용
- Breitling + VacheronConstatntin + AudemarsPiguet ⇒ Arianee 설립
    - 마찬가지로 명품 시계의 실제 소유자 등록 및 허위 매물 걸러내기에 사용됨
- Nike > Cryptokicks 블록체인 시스템 개발 및 특허 출원
    - 리셀 시장이 엄청 크다. 중고거래시 정품인증으로 활용 가능
    - 실물을 구매하면 동일한 메타버스 아이템을 제공해줌
- Toyota > 중고차 거래 시장 허위매물, 차량 정비이력 등을 투명하게 나타내기 위해 NFT 발행
- Burberry > Blankos Block Party 자체개발 블록체인 게임 출시
    - 게이머들이 아이템 거래 시, Burberry 가 수익의 n%를 가져가는 형태
- D&G > Collezione Genesi - NFT 콜렉션 출시
    - 메타버스에서 착용가능한 아이템 판매
- Louis Vuitton > Louis the Game - 모바일 게임 출시
    - MZ 세대들의 관심을 모으기 위함
- Gucci X Roblox > 로블록스 내에서 구찌 아이템 판매

**왜 하는가?**

- 새로운 소비 시장 확장
    - 전통적인 게임에서의 아이템은 희소성 개념이 크게 없었지만, 블록체인 게임 안에서의 아이템은 독점성과 희소성을 줄 수 있다.
- 젊은 층을 고객으로 끌어들이기 위해

### [월가에서 바라보는 NFT 열풍 + 크립토 시장 리뷰](https://youtu.be/yMo_vIl5tAs?t=1718)
28:38 유독 대기업들의 참여가 활발한 '한국시장의 NFT 열풍' 에 대한 의견.

NCSoft, Kakao, Line, Hybe 모두가 NFT 에 뛰어드는 이 상황을 어떻게 바라봐야하고, 그래서 무엇에 집중해야하는지에 대한 힌트를 얻을 수 있었다.

1. Metaverse
- Metaverse 자체를 만든다기보다 그 안에서 쓰일 수 있는 Identification 에 사용될 도구를 만드는것에 집중

2. Play-to-earn
- Crypto 와 관련없는 사람들을 Crypto 영역으로 불러오기
- Strong Global IP + Blockchain 의 조합이 기대됨
- 현재 NFT 게임들은 Cyrpto 영역에 있는 사람들에게만 한정된 경향이 있음.
- 일반 대중들﹣Kakao/Line Mobile Games 유저들﹣에게까지 Crypto/NFT 프로젝트가 닿기 위해서는 유통 채널 확보가 중요.

3. Gamification of Defi
- 금융 서비스/플랫폼 + NFT

**미국시장의 키워드**
- NFT 시장에 누가 뛰어드는지가 이슈되는 상황은 지났고 이제는 '그래서 뭘 만들건지' 에 대해.
- NFT Algo-trading Funds
- NFTs and physical assets
- 단순 play to earn 을 넘어선 MMORPG Games 등

o-theophilus/avour,JavaScript,"# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

canguruhh/myetpbot,JavaScript,"# MyETPBot
This is a simple telegram bot to get information about the Metaverse Blockchain.

# Setup
First you need to create a Telegram bot. To do so you have to connect to BotFather and use the `/newbot` command. Then just follow the instructions. You will get a token that you will need in order to configure the bot:

``` bash
npm install
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_token
node index.js
```

# How does it work?
It creates a bot object that connects to telegram and emits events for new incomming messages to your bot. To respond to different inputs the commands are defined as regular expressions that match the message text.

If the commands requires the loading of external data (from the explorer) it caches them for later requests from other users.

On startup it also sends a message with the common commands as a keyboard layer. Functions that require feedback are implemented as callback messages that contain a stringified data object.

A more detailed introduction you can find on [Medium](https://medium.com/@canguruhh/how-to-create-a-node-js-telegram-chatbot-3535068b0596)

genesis-worlds/governance,HTML,"# GENESIS Hub

This site holds the code for the Genesis Hub. It includes the core vision for the Genesis multicreator gaming universe, governance processes and procedures, the community improvement process, as well as key resources such as the roadmap.

# GENESIS Community Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/FIXME/CIPs?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

Community Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Genesis platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.

**Before you initiate a pull request**, please read the [CIP-1](https://hub.gamecredits.org/cips/cip-1) process document. Ideas should be thoroughly discussed prior to opening a pull request, such as on the [Genesis forums](https://FIXME.org) or in a GitHub issue in this repository.

This repository tracks the ongoing status of CIPs. It contains:

- [Draft](https://hub.gamecredits.org/all#draft) proposals which intend to complete the CIP review process.
- [Last Call](https://hub.gamecredits.org/all#last-call) for proposals that may become final (see also [RSS feed](https://hub.gamecredits.org/last-call.xml)).
- [Accepted](https://hub.gamecredits.org/all#accepted) proposals which are awaiting implementation or deployment by Genesis client developers.
- [Final](https://hub.gamecredits.org/all#final) and [Active](https://hub.gamecredits.org/all#active) proposals that are recorded.
- The [CIP process](./cips/cip-1.md#cip-work-flow) that governs the CIP repository.

Achieving ""Final"" status in this repository only represents that a proposal has been reviewed for technical accuracy. It is solely the responsibility of the reader to decide whether a proposal will be useful to them.

Browse all current and draft CIPs on [the official CIP site](https://hub.gamecredits.org/).

Once your first PR is merged, we have a bot that helps out by automatically merging PRs to draft CIPs. For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the 'author' line of your CIP contains either your GitHub username or your email address inside \<triangular brackets>. If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on [your GitHub profile](https://github.com/settings/profile).

## Project Goal

The Community Improvement Proposals repository exists as a place to share concrete proposals with potential users of the proposal and the Genesis community at large.

## Preferred Citation Format

The canonical URL for a CIP that has achieved draft status at any point is at https://hub.gamecredits.org/. For example, the canonical URL for CIP-1 is https://hub.gamecredits.org/cips/cip-1.

Please consider anything which is not published on https://hub.gamecredits.org/ as a working paper.

And please consider anything published at https://hub.gamecredits.org/ with a status of ""draft"" as an incomplete draft.

# Validation

CIPs must pass some validation tests.  The CIP repository ensures this by running tests using [html-proofer](https://rubygems.org/gems/html-proofer) and [eip_validator](https://rubygems.org/gems/eip_validator).

It is possible to run the CIP validator locally:
```sh
gem install eip_validator
eip_validator <INPUT_FILES>
```

# Automerger

The CIP repository contains an ""auto merge"" feature to ease the workload for CIP editors.  If a change is made via a PR to a draft CIP, then the authors of the CIP can GitHub approve the change to have it auto-merged by the [cip-automerger](https://github.com/FIXMEcip-automerger/automerger) bot.

sorengranfeldt/mre,C#,"# Project Description
This FIM2010 R2 Codeless Provisioning Framework called Forefront Identity Manager 2010 (FIM) Metaverse Rules Extension (hereafter MRE) is a standalone extension that allows for administrators to create advanced provisioning and deprovisioning [rules] for FIM without writing a single line of code.

The use of MRE can of course be combined with Declarative Provisioning using Synchronization Rules (SR's) in FIM 2010. Sometimes, you may just need to provision some object between a few MA's without the need for these objects to go to the FIM Service to have a Synchronization Rule (SR) applied and that is where the MRE comes in handy.

By creating an XML document using a text or XML editor, FIM administrators are able to build, change or remove provisioning and deprovisioning [rules] in FIM without recompiling. Basically, MRE enables codeless provisioning in FIM and acts as a replacement or a supplement for Synchronization Rules (SR's) in FIM.

To learn more, please see Wiki.

Enjoy,

# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
node scripts/deploy.js
npx eslint '**/*.js'
npx eslint '**/*.js' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.js
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS ""Hello, Hardhat!""
```

<!-- /TOC -->


# 1. Introduction
Bit.Country is a decentralized world. The concept is uniquely invented and inspired by the decentralization paradigm.
Its vision is to allow anyone (especially new users to the blockchain) to create their communities, economics as Bit Country on the blockchain network.

Users can create their own countries, blocks, sections, and items as digital assets with NFTs. The UI offers both a classical web view and a 3D in-browser view of the country. The decentralized marketplace allows users to trade their digital assets with each other.

# 2. Overview

Bit.Country provides a new way to socialize with a game feel, while also being driven by real economics.

* A decentralized world - putting community first.
* An open NFT/game protocol for managing & incentivizing small-medium communities using gamification.

# 3. Build

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Initialize your Wasm Build environment:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

# 4. Run

### Single Node Development Chain

Purge any existing developer chain state:

```bash
./target/release/bitcountry-node purge-chain --dev
```

Start a development chain with:

```bash
./target/release/bitcountry-node --dev
```

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -- --dev`.

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain that have been endowed with testnet units.

Optionally, give each node a name and expose them so they are listed on the Polkadot [telemetry site](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Local%20Testnet).

You'll need two terminal windows open.

We'll start Alice's substrate node first on default TCP port 30333 with her chain database stored locally at `/tmp/alice`. The bootnode ID of her node is `QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR`, which is generated from the `--node-key` value that we specify below:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --base-path /tmp/alice \
  --chain=local \
  --alice \
  --node-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

In the second terminal, we'll start Bob's substrate node on a different TCP port of 30334, and with his chain database stored locally at `/tmp/bob`. We'll specify a value for the `--bootnodes` option that will connect his node to Alice's bootnode ID on TCP port 30333:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --base-path /tmp/bob \
  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR \
  --chain=local \
  --bob \
  --port 30334 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

MetaverseBot is a program, which is using Selenium to automate land buying process.
Land is specific piece of NFT, which is used as a basic unit in SB metaverse. That makes every land public sale event extremely popular.
So to buy land, user needs to have ""fastest hand in the whole wild west"" or user may apply this script.

The most important thing about this program, is that the basic ""skeleton"" may be applied on different metaverses (and even other services), which are using Cloudflare antibot system. It is possible since program use particular methods to bypass Cloudflare.

MetaVerseMagna/metaverseMagna,Solidity,"# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js

# 1. Introduction
Bit.Country is a decentralized world. The concept is uniquely invented and inspired by the decentralization paradigm.
Its vision is to allow anyone (especially new users to the blockchain) to create their communities, economics as Bit Country on the blockchain network.

Users can create their own countries, blocks, sections, and items as digital assets with NFTs. The UI offers both a classical web view and a 3D in-browser view of the country. The decentralized marketplace allows users to trade their digital assets with each other.

# 2. Overview

Bit.Country provides a new way to socialize with a game feel, while also being driven by real economics.

* A decentralized world - putting community first.
* An open NFT/game protocol for managing & incentivizing small-medium communities using gamification.

# 3. Build

Install Rust:

```bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Initialize your Wasm Build environment:

```bash
./scripts/init.sh
```

Build Wasm and native code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

# 4. Run

### Single Node Development Chain

Purge any existing developer chain state:

```bash
./target/release/bitcountry-node purge-chain --dev
```

Start a development chain with:

```bash
./target/release/bitcountry-node --dev
```

Detailed logs may be shown by running the node with the following environment variables set: `RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run -- --dev`.

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action locally, then you can create a local testnet with two validator nodes for Alice and Bob, who are the initial authorities of the genesis chain that have been endowed with testnet units.

Optionally, give each node a name and expose them so they are listed on the Polkadot [telemetry site](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#/Local%20Testnet).

You'll need two terminal windows open.

We'll start Alice's substrate node first on default TCP port 30333 with her chain database stored locally at `/tmp/alice`. The bootnode ID of her node is `QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR`, which is generated from the `--node-key` value that we specify below:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --base-path /tmp/alice \
  --chain=local \
  --alice \
  --node-key 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

In the second terminal, we'll start Bob's substrate node on a different TCP port of 30334, and with his chain database stored locally at `/tmp/bob`. We'll specify a value for the `--bootnodes` option that will connect his node to Alice's bootnode ID on TCP port 30333:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --base-path /tmp/bob \
  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/QmRpheLN4JWdAnY7HGJfWFNbfkQCb6tFf4vvA6hgjMZKrR \
  --chain=local \
  --bob \
  --port 30334 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator
```

May be useful to buy land in metaverse

MetaverseBot is a program, which is using Selenium to automate land buying process.
Land is specific piece of NFT, which is used as a basic unit in SB metaverse. That makes every land public sale event extremely popular.
So to buy land, user needs to have ""fastest hand in the whole wild west"" or user may apply this script.

The most important thing about this program, is that the basic ""skeleton"" may be applied on different metaverses (and even other services), which are using Cloudflare antibot system. It is possible since program use particular methods to bypass Cloudflare.

This project was generated with [BàngáJS](https://bangajs.netlify.app/) v2.0.0.  

## Installation

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`

2. Create a new file `.env` if it doesn't exist and copy the contents of `env.dev` into it to be able to run your server on production environment. 

3. Then you need to provide values for the configuration env files at the `src/config/env directory`.


## Running the server locally

1. Start up the server - Run `npm start` | `npm run dev`

2. Server should be running on http://localhost:2020/ by default

eserilev/MetaverseETF,Solidity,
HGChamara/MetaverseLand,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

=============

""kernel"" example of a 3d virtual world built on processing.  

Metaverse Core is my attempt to fill the current void of a ""kernel' a-la-Torvalds in the virtual world, 
for running user-defined virtul world environments.  I have writeen this personal version of Metaverse Core
to be a cool place for musicians and creative people to hang out and play with the given control features.  
One can make songs and mix them in with the room's audio or just keepo them local.  

There are other such efforts, such as Sunny's world which is a good bit further along than Metaverse Core
though hit lacks the flexibility and creative expression capabilities of Metaverse Core.  That's because 
programers can create with Metaverse Core.  They can make an operating system for a computer based on 
3DVW immersion, or maybe a chatroom with our selves scanned with 3D cameras.  

There are many thoughts that go along with Metaverse Core that define what it hopes to become, though it's
fair to say that any decent ""real programmer (TM)"" unlike me as scripter can grok what i did well enough to
reode it properly at least once, to create a clean core for people to work with.  maybe it should be a library.  

There is so much to write that I must stop for now and try to recall the better thoughts later.  enjoy.

ESNJS/MetaverseNFT,Solidity,"# Non-Fungible Tokens for image collectibles

This repo provides the reference codes for implementation of NFT smart-contracts that govern the behavior of collectible units.

This contracts represent a set of NFTs that contain recorded data in JSON format on-chain. NFTs can be grouped in ""classes"" to refer to class-related metadata which is shared among the NFTs belonging to one class (this optimizes on-chain data usage). User can also record his own metadata in text format to his owned NFT.

Owner of the contract can create new classes at the contract and assign them to an Auction. Auctions sell NFTs according to the chosen rules. There can be two types of auctions - Linear and Biddable.

Linear auctions allow users to buy NFTs at a fixed price stright from the contract.

Biddable auctions allow users to bid on NFTs and the highest bid wins after fixed time period.

# Structure

- [ImagesNFT.sol](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFT.sol) - this is an old version of the contract. It is kept for documentation purposes and it will be removed in the future

- [ImagesNFTv2.sol](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol) - this is a relevant implementation based on [CallistoNFT](https://github.com/Dexaran/CallistoNFT) and [Classified CallistoNFT](https://github.com/Dexaran/CallistoNFT/blob/main/Extensions/ClassifiedNFT.sol) extension.

- [Proxy.sol](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/Proxy.sol) - upgradeable proxy to keep contracts upgradeable during the development process.

# Deployment (contracts)

Solidity version 0.8.0. These contracts are designed to work with Ethereum Virtual Machine and therefore the contracts can be compiled and deployed to any chain that supports EVM including Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum CLassic, TRX, Callisto Network, PIRL etc.

Deployment process must be as follows:

1. Pick a contract and compile it (ImagesNFTv2.sol) - the relevant contract is [contract ArtefinNFT](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1011-L1064). Deploy the bytecode of the contract to a desired network (mainnet or testnet).
2. Compile the Proxy.sol - the relevant contract is [NFTUpgradeableProxy](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/Proxy.sol#L458-L463)
3. Deploy the compiled Proxy contract and assign constructor parameters - `admin` is the owner address, `logic` is the address of the ImagesNFTv2 contract created at step 1, `data` is a special value that encodes the initialization call, data must be `b119490e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000074172746566696e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000034152540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in case of this particular contracts. The proxy contract automatically calls [initialize()](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1013-L1022) upon creation.

# Deployment (auctions)

1. Replace the [hardcoded address of the revenue receiver](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1241) with your address.
2. Compile [Linear Auction code](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1081) or [Biddable Auction code](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1201)
3. Deploy the compiled code to the desired network.
4. `Auction contract:` Configure the NFT contract with the [setNFTContract](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1261-L1266) function.
5. `NFT contract:` In order to be allowed to create NFTs the auction contract must be assigned the ""Minter Role"". Assign the minter permissions to the Auction contract address created at step 3 with the [setMinterRole](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L131-L134) function at the NFT contract.
6. `NFT contract:` Create a new NFT class that will represent a group of assets that can be sold at the auction contract with [addNewTokenClass()](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L933) function at the NFT contract.
7. `NFT contract:` (OPTIONAL) Assign class properties with [addTokenClassProperties](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L939) function.
8. `NFT contract:` (OPTIONAL) Configure the content of token properties with the [modifyClassProperty](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L947) function. NOTE: Properties can not be removed in the current implementation of the contract. However the owner can `modify` a token property to make it empty.
9. `Auction contract:` Assign a new auction at the auction contract with the [createNFTAuction](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1111) function. `uint256 _classID` parameter must be the ID of created class at the auction contract. Auction can only sell assets of a created class. NOTE: One class can be only assigned to one type of auction. This contracts are not designed to allow one class of NFTs to be tradeable on multiple auctions at the same time.

### 需求痛点
基本所有的应用都需要头像.  对于头像,大家的做法都是用户上传一张图片的方式, 如下图:

![image](http://oss.faceface2.com/facecloud/pic/3ecaAa.jpeg)

这样的体验方式,用户需要时刻在相册中保留一样图片,并记住在哪里.

为什么没有一种方式,为用户提供很好看的头像, 直接让用户选择呢? 于是就有了该项目.

as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

</details>

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/<repoName>/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/<repoName>), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

## Version history

**Version history currently unavailable**

**No other versions listed**

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation ""Digital Restrictions Management"" instead of the more known ""Digital Rights Management"" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling ""Digital Restrictions Management"" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.

# FrontEnd - Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Il s’agit de développer une application web permettant à une communauté de cryptophiles
d'échanger sur les cryptomonnaies du métavers (https://cryptoast.fr/metaverse-comprendre-mondesvirtuels-blockchains-nfts/). Les membres de la communauté inscrits dans l'application peuvent créer
des annonces pour promouvoir des cryptomonnaies. Ils peuvent aussi émettre un avis sur les
différentes cryptomonnaies disponibles dans l'application

janeyeon/MetaverseCompetition,Swift,"# Visualizing and Interacting with a Reconstructed Scene

Estimate the shape of the physical environment using a polygonal mesh.

## Overview

On a fourth-generation iPad Pro running iPad OS 13.4 or later, ARKit uses the LiDAR Scanner to create a polygonal model of the physical environment. The LiDAR Scanner quickly retrieves depth information from a wide area in front of the user, so ARKit can estimate the shape of the real world without requiring the user to move. ARKit converts the depth information into a series of vertices that connect to form a *mesh*. To partition the information, ARKit makes multiple anchors, each assigned a unique portion of the mesh. Collectively, the mesh anchors represent the real-world *scene* around the user.

With these meshes, you can:
* More accurately locate points on real-world surfaces.
* Classify real-world objects that ARKit can recognize.
* Occlude your app’s virtual content with real-world objects that are in front of it.
* Have virtual content interact with the physical environment realistically, for example, by bouncing a virtual ball off a real-world wall and having the ball follow the laws of physics. 

This sample app presents an AR experience using RealityKit. The figure below illustrates how RealityKit leverages real-world information from ARKit, and creates a debug visualization when you run this app and point the device at a real-world chair.

![Screenshot of a chair visible in the camera feed with a mesh overlay visualized by RealityKit.](Documentation/meshing3-annotated.png)

## Visualize the Shape of the Physical Environment

To enable scene meshes, the sample sets a world-configuration's [`sceneReconstruction`][12] property to one of the mesh options.

``` swift
arView.automaticallyConfigureSession = false
let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
configuration.sceneReconstruction = .meshWithClassification
```

The sample uses RealityKit's [`ARView`][10] to render its graphics. To visualize meshes at runtime, [`ARView`][10] offers the [`.showSceneUnderstanding`][13] debugging option.

``` swift
arView.debugOptions.insert(.showSceneUnderstanding)
```

- Note: The sample enables mesh visualization only to demonstrate the mesh feature; similarly, you normally enable mesh visualization only for debugging purposes.

To begin the AR experience, the sample configures and runs the session when the app first starts, in the main view controller's [`viewDidLoad`](x-source-tag://viewDidLoad) callback. 

``` swift
arView.session.run(configuration)
```

## Add Plane Detection

When an app enables plane detection with scene reconstruction, ARKit considers that information when making the mesh. Where the LiDAR scanner may produce a slightly uneven mesh on a real-world surface, ARKit smooths out the mesh where it detects a plane on that surface. 

To demonstrate the difference that plane detection makes on meshes, this app displays a toggle button. In the button handler, the sample adjusts the plane-detection configuration and restarts the session to effect the change.

``` swift
@IBAction func togglePlaneDetectionButtonPressed(_ button: UIButton) {
    guard let configuration = arView.session.configuration as? ARWorldTrackingConfiguration else {
        return
    }
    if configuration.planeDetection == [] {
        configuration.planeDetection = [.horizontal, .vertical]
        button.setTitle(""Stop Plane Detection"", for: [])
    } else {
        configuration.planeDetection = []
        button.setTitle(""Start Plane Detection"", for: [])
    }
    arView.session.run(configuration)
}
```

## Locate a Point on an Object's Surface

Apps that retrieve surface locations using meshes can achieve unprecedented accuracy. By considering the mesh, raycasts can intersect with nonplanar surfaces, or surfaces with little or no features, like white walls. 

To demonstrate accurate raycast results, this app casts a ray when the user taps the screen. The sample specifies the [`.estimatedPlane`][9] allowable-target, and [`.any`][8] alignment option, as required to retrieve a point on a meshed, real-world object.

``` swift
let tapLocation = sender.location(in: arView)
if let result = arView.raycast(from: tapLocation, allowing: .estimatedPlane, alignment: .any).first {
    // ...
```

![Figure of a meshed, real-world vase with a ray intersecting its surface.](Documentation/armchair-annotated.png)

When the user's raycast returns a result, this app gives visual feedback by placing a small sphere at the intersection point. 

``` swift
let resultAnchor = AnchorEntity(world: result.worldTransform)
resultAnchor.addChild(sphere(radius: 0.01, color: .lightGray))
arView.scene.addAnchor(resultAnchor, removeAfter: 3)
```

![Screenshot of a virtual sphere placed on the surface of a mesh that intersected the user's raycast.](Documentation/insersection-sphere-annotated.png)

## Classify Real-World Objects

ARKit has a classification feature that analyzes its meshed model of the world to recognize specific, real-world objects. Within the mesh, ARKit can classify floors, tables, seats, windows, and ceilings. See [`ARMeshClassification`][11] for the full list.

If the user taps the screen and the raycast intersects with a meshed, real-world object, this app displays text of the mesh's classification. 

![Figure of a meshed, real-world vase with a label that displays its classification.](Documentation/classified-sized.png)

When the [`automaticallyConfigureSession`][3] property of [`ARView`][10] is `true`, RealityKit disables classification by default because it isn’t required for occlusion and physics. To enable mesh classification, the sample overrides the default by setting the [`sceneReconstruction`][12] property to [`.meshWithClassification`][16].

``` swift
arView.automaticallyConfigureSession = false
let configuration = ARWorldTrackingConfiguration()
configuration.sceneReconstruction = .meshWithClassification
```

This app attempts to retrieve a classification for the intersection point from the mesh.

``` swift
nearbyFaceWithClassification(to: result.worldTransform.position) { (centerOfFace, classification) in
    // ...
```

Every three vertices in the mesh form a triangle, called a *face.* ARKit assigns a classification for each face, so the sample searches through the mesh for a face near the intersection point. If the face has a classification, this app displays it on screen. Because this routine involves extensive processing, the sample does the work asynchronously, so the renderer does not stall.

``` swift
DispatchQueue.global().async {
    for anchor in meshAnchors {
        for index in 0..<anchor.geometry.faces.count {
            // Get the center of the face so that we can compare it to the given location.
            let geometricCenterOfFace = anchor.geometry.centerOf(faceWithIndex: index)
            
            // Convert the face's center to world coordinates.
            var centerLocalTransform = matrix_identity_float4x4
            centerLocalTransform.columns.3 = SIMD4<Float>(geometricCenterOfFace.0, geometricCenterOfFace.1, geometricCenterOfFace.2, 1)
            let centerWorldPosition = (anchor.transform * centerLocalTransform).position
             
            // We're interested in a classification that is sufficiently close to the given location––within 5 cm.
            let distanceToFace = distance(centerWorldPosition, location)
            if distanceToFace <= 0.05 {
                // Get the semantic classification of the face and finish the search.
                let classification: ARMeshClassification = anchor.geometry.classificationOf(faceWithIndex: index)
                completionBlock(centerWorldPosition, classification)
                return
            }
        }
    }
```

With the classification in-hand, the sample creates 3D text to display it.

``` swift
let textEntity = self.model(for: classification)
```

To prevent the mesh from partially occluding the text, the sample offsets the text slightly to help readability. The sample calculates the offset in the negative direction of the ray, which effectively moves the text slightly toward the camera, which is away from the surface. 

``` swift
let rayDirection = normalize(result.worldTransform.position - self.arView.cameraTransform.translation)
let textPositionInWorldCoordinates = result.worldTransform.position - (rayDirection * 0.1)
```

To make the text always appear the same size on screen, the sample applies a scale based on text's distance from the camera.

``` swift
let raycastDistance = distance(result.worldTransform.position, self.arView.cameraTransform.translation)
textEntity.scale = .one * raycastDistance
```

To display the text, the sample puts it in an anchored entity at the adjusted intersection-point, which is oriented to face the camera. 

``` swift
var resultWithCameraOrientation = self.arView.cameraTransform
resultWithCameraOrientation.translation = textPositionInWorldCoordinates
let textAnchor = AnchorEntity(world: resultWithCameraOrientation.matrix)
textAnchor.addChild(textEntity)
self.arView.scene.addAnchor(textAnchor, removeAfter: 3)
```

To visualize the location of the face's vertex from which the classification was retrieved, the sample creates a small sphere at the vertex's real-world position.

``` swift
if let centerOfFace = centerOfFace {
    let faceAnchor = AnchorEntity(world: centerOfFace)
    faceAnchor.addChild(self.sphere(radius: 0.01, color: classification.color))
    self.arView.scene.addAnchor(faceAnchor, removeAfter: 3)
}
```

## Occlude Virtual Content with a Mesh

*Occlusion* is a feature where parts of the real world cover an app's virtual content, from the camera's perspective. To achieve this illusion, RealityKit checks for any meshes in front of virtual content, viewed by the user, and omits drawing any part of the virtual content obscured by those meshes. The sample enables occlusion by adding the [`.occlusion`][14] option to the environment's [`sceneUnderstanding`][13] property.

``` swift
arView.environment.sceneUnderstanding.options.insert(.occlusion)
```

At runtime, this app omits drawing portions of the virtual text that are behind any part of the meshed, real world. 

![Screenshot of a real-world table that occludes a virtual object placed by the app.](Documentation/table-floor-annotated.png)

## Interact with Real-World Objects Using Physics

With scene meshes, virtual content can interact with the physical environment realistically because the meshes give RealityKit's physics engine an accurate model of the world. The sample enables physics by adding the [`.physics`][15] option to the environment's [`sceneUnderstanding`][13] property.

``` swift
arView.environment.sceneUnderstanding.options.insert(.physics)
```

To detect when virtual content comes in contact with a meshed, real-world object, the sample defines the text's proportions using a collision shape in the [`addAnchor(_:,removeAfter:)`](x-source-tag://AddAnchorExtension) [`Scene`][7] extension.

``` swift
if model.collision == nil {
    model.generateCollisionShapes(recursive: true)
    model.physicsBody = .init()
}
```

When this app classifies an object and displays some text, it waits three seconds before dropping the virtual text. When the sample sets the text's [`physicsBody`][4]'s [`mode`][5] to [`.dynamic`][6], the text reacts to gravity by falling.

``` swift
Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: seconds, repeats: false) { (timer) in
    model.physicsBody?.mode = .dynamic
}
```

As the text falls, it reacts when colliding with a meshed, real-world object, such as landing on the floor.

ESNJS/MetaverseNFT,Solidity,"# Non-Fungible Tokens for image collectibles

This repo provides the reference codes for implementation of NFT smart-contracts that govern the behavior of collectible units.

This contracts represent a set of NFTs that contain recorded data in JSON format on-chain. NFTs can be grouped in ""classes"" to refer to class-related metadata which is shared among the NFTs belonging to one class (this optimizes on-chain data usage). User can also record his own metadata in text format to his owned NFT.

Owner of the contract can create new classes at the contract and assign them to an Auction. Auctions sell NFTs according to the chosen rules. There can be two types of auctions - Linear and Biddable.

Linear auctions allow users to buy NFTs at a fixed price stright from the contract.

Biddable auctions allow users to bid on NFTs and the highest bid wins after fixed time period.

# Structure

- [ImagesNFT.sol](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFT.sol) - this is an old version of the contract. It is kept for documentation purposes and it will be removed in the future

- [ImagesNFTv2.sol](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol) - this is a relevant implementation based on [CallistoNFT](https://github.com/Dexaran/CallistoNFT) and [Classified CallistoNFT](https://github.com/Dexaran/CallistoNFT/blob/main/Extensions/ClassifiedNFT.sol) extension.

- [Proxy.sol](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/Proxy.sol) - upgradeable proxy to keep contracts upgradeable during the development process.

# Deployment (contracts)

Solidity version 0.8.0. These contracts are designed to work with Ethereum Virtual Machine and therefore the contracts can be compiled and deployed to any chain that supports EVM including Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum CLassic, TRX, Callisto Network, PIRL etc.

Deployment process must be as follows:

1. Pick a contract and compile it (ImagesNFTv2.sol) - the relevant contract is [contract ArtefinNFT](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1011-L1064). Deploy the bytecode of the contract to a desired network (mainnet or testnet).
2. Compile the Proxy.sol - the relevant contract is [NFTUpgradeableProxy](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/Proxy.sol#L458-L463)
3. Deploy the compiled Proxy contract and assign constructor parameters - `admin` is the owner address, `logic` is the address of the ImagesNFTv2 contract created at step 1, `data` is a special value that encodes the initialization call, data must be `b119490e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000074172746566696e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000034152540000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` in case of this particular contracts. The proxy contract automatically calls [initialize()](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1013-L1022) upon creation.

# Deployment (auctions)

1. Replace the [hardcoded address of the revenue receiver](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1241) with your address.
2. Compile [Linear Auction code](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1081) or [Biddable Auction code](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1201)
3. Deploy the compiled code to the desired network.
4. `Auction contract:` Configure the NFT contract with the [setNFTContract](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1261-L1266) function.
5. `NFT contract:` In order to be allowed to create NFTs the auction contract must be assigned the ""Minter Role"". Assign the minter permissions to the Auction contract address created at step 3 with the [setMinterRole](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L131-L134) function at the NFT contract.
6. `NFT contract:` Create a new NFT class that will represent a group of assets that can be sold at the auction contract with [addNewTokenClass()](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L933) function at the NFT contract.
7. `NFT contract:` (OPTIONAL) Assign class properties with [addTokenClassProperties](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L939) function.
8. `NFT contract:` (OPTIONAL) Configure the content of token properties with the [modifyClassProperty](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L947) function. NOTE: Properties can not be removed in the current implementation of the contract. However the owner can `modify` a token property to make it empty.
9. `Auction contract:` Assign a new auction at the auction contract with the [createNFTAuction](https://github.com/Dexaran/ImageNFT/blob/main/ImagesNFTv2.sol#L1111) function. `uint256 _classID` parameter must be the ID of created class at the auction contract. Auction can only sell assets of a created class. NOTE: One class can be only assigned to one type of auction. This contracts are not designed to allow one class of NFTs to be tradeable on multiple auctions at the same time.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

marcosmoran/MetaverseVRAdvertisements,ShaderLab,"Metaverse Advertising planning Guide

The metaverse opens up new opportunities for meaningful marketing, this step forward allows companies to explore brand new ways to reach their audiences. For this reason, I have reimagined advertising as an interactive experience, where the customer can really be part of the advertisement.

There are multiple ways this concept can be approached, I have outlined 3 possible experience types base on the demographic targeting: 

Passive Experience-
Target: Light VR Users, older audiences
Provides a storytelling experience, good for fatigued users in context that requires a lot of interaction or multiple ads.

Semi Passive Experience
Target : Users that are adapting to VR, 
Allows for a good blend of interaction and storytelling, engaging the user in a way that will not overwhelm them.

Playable Experience
Target: Young Generation / VR users
Allows for a great range of user interaction and engagement


Below is the storyboard example of what a Semi Passive experience for a drinks company

Introduction
User finds themselves inside virtual reality, they are in a desert landscape, the scene is color graded and sound designed to really sell the experience and feel heat.
There are heat distortion effects in the distance and blowing sand particles.

Acclimatization
The user can see a slight figure directly ahead, and the option to teleport forwards, we want the user to feel as they have seen a mirage and they are chasing it,

First Interaction
As the user moves forwards it is apparent that there is a podium they are approaching, with a bottle of drink on top.
Hero Moment
The user is prompted to grab the bottle and physically open it by hand, really selling the VR interaction.

Climax
Once the user opens the bottle a bright light appears from inside the bottle, creating the whole environment to shine, and the screen goes fully white, the user is transported to a vibrant lush oasis full of colour and vegetation.

Branding
The final part allows for the company ethos and branding to be shown concluding the experience."

## About MetaVoxel

[![SnowCrash DAO](snowcrashdao/img/logo/SnowCrashDAO-canalblue-blue-min-100x50.svg)](https://snowcrash.finance/)

> MetaVoxel is a fully decentralized world (Metaverse) inspired by Minecraft and constructed by infinite voxels. MetaVoxel is controlled via the DAO. Via the DAO, you decide and vote on how the world works.

In MetaVoxel, players can mine and build as much as they want. There are many islands in MetaVoxel, some of which contain large amounts of ores (such as iron, stone, etc.) and some rare treasures (such as gold, diamonds, ancient fossils, etc.). Players can use ore-making tools to build houses, or exchange for other valuable items (of course, they can sell these ores). There are also some islands with a beautiful environment and lots of animals and plants, which are very suitable for players to settle down, set up and operate their own virtual companies.

mhuon/metaverse,,"# metaverse

A platform to easily engage advertising/marketing networks with virtual assets in the meta world.

### Imagine

Imagine you could view a sub meta world space in which you can place your ads in. For this example I'm using games but you can realize this concept to any virtual world that people would participate in actively or passively.

First option would be to choose your world you'd like to place your ad content in and let's say you know certain major events will happenn in the future.  Under campaigns you can see the list of events.

![alt text](https://github.com/mhuon/metaverse/blob/main/images/ss1.png?raw=true)

For each campaign you get to see the virtual world for which your ad content will be present:

1. Billboard content
2. Virtual interactable content via 3d mesh
3. Sound bite content interaction with world and user

All 3 items above could potentially be their own subdivision/company. #1 could involve deep fake suite of tools allowing quick and easy placement of real life people(tom cruise) into virtual billboard ads without them even having to step out the door. #2 Content tools to aide in simplification of mesh design onto 3d objects. 3# again utilizing ai this could take a list of sounds/words and build a complete library of a person's voice(arnold schwarzenegger)

![alt text](https://github.com/mhuon/metaverse/blob/main/images/ss2.png?raw=true)

After you have decided which segment of space you want your ad content to be present you can bid on that particular space.

![alt text](https://github.com/mhuon/metaverse/blob/main/images/ss3.png?raw=true)

![alt text](https://github.com/mhuon/metaverse/blob/main/images/ss5.png?raw=true)

### Result

What would this be if you couldn't actual see this in a virtual world. Let me demonstrate loading this dynamic ad content that has been bidded on and is now the winning content to display:  To make this more relevant I've placed an ad you'll recognize.

nettmaker-lasse/metaverse,JavaScript,"This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Rikarin Metaverse is a 3D web browser for browsing lands instead of websites. The main idea is based on concept of mixing web browser with decentralized VR like SecondLife. 

Lands (Pages) can be written in similar language as HTML (DTML)  
and stylized in similar language as CSS (DSS).

For writing functional code C# can be used (instead of JS like in traditional websites).


HUD - 2D GUI can be also developed within DTML and DSS.


For writing dynamic backend C# can be used with our basic server template which includes (will include) avatar sync, chat, voice chat and many more.

Metaverse Search Protocol - Python-based tools for generating crossovers

`metaverse.py` - https://github.com/TheMindVirus/metaverse/blob/main/Industries/metaverse.py

![screenshot](https://github.com/TheMindVirus/metaverse/blob/main/screenshot.png)

This specific example contains a limited dataset of over 500 company logos. \
Not all of the company logos are present in the dataset and those missing can be added. \
The current dataset is there only to evaluate the usefulness of this crossover generator tool.

If you're struggling to think about all the logos at the same time, don't worry, that's fairly normal. \
This is the same confusion that shop customers go through when figuring out what to buy next. \
Having a Metaverse of tools like this may be able to ease the confusion and \
could also bring about new things that wouldn't normally have been thought about.

![screenshot2](https://github.com/TheMindVirus/metaverse/blob/main/screenshot2.png)

A crossover in this context is simply 2 randomly selected logos multiplied together. \
The wider meaning of a crossover can vary greatly, but ideally leads to innovative new ideas \
combining the strengths (and weaknesses) of the two or more selected universes.

The `search` tools were added and customised initially to check if a logo had already been added or not. \
There may be other potential uses and optimisations for the search tool.

The `cross` tool was added to make selecting 2 random logos and combining them together easier to do. \
It may also have a variety of potential uses and added features that have yet to be written.

You can add your own custom tools with their own unique names using the included Python script. \
An example of a tool you may want to add is a ""Dots on a Circle"" graph representing links between universes.

## Notes

The following ideas brought this repository into existence and are largely based on subtractive synthesis:

```
 * Start by adding .png images of every logo identity you can think of and keep adding to the dataset
 * Filter out certain images by either randomly or deliberately selecting them based on a pattern/distribution
 * Extrapolate and Analyse the contents and meanings of each selected image (perhaps also included in metadata)
 * Combine certain features of one selection with those of another to form a new overlapping idea (or ""crossover"")
 * Evaluate the new selection based on logical criteria derived from personal, ethical and human values
 * Make a decision on whether or not to take the new idea forward to be further refined or made into a product.
```

## WARNING: This tool is potentially very powerful. Please use it with care.

This specific example contains a limited dataset of over 500 company logos. \
Not all of the company logos are present in the dataset and those missing can be added. \
The current dataset is there only to evaluate the usefulness of this crossover generator tool.

If you're struggling to think about all the logos at the same time, don't worry, that's fairly normal. \
This is the same confusion that shop customers go through when figuring out what to buy next. \
Having a Metaverse of tools like this may be able to ease the confusion and \
could also bring about new things that wouldn't normally have been thought about.

![screenshot2](https://github.com/TheMindVirus/metaverse/blob/main/screenshot2.png)

A crossover in this context is simply 2 randomly selected logos multiplied together. \
The wider meaning of a crossover can vary greatly, but ideally leads to innovative new ideas \
combining the strengths (and weaknesses) of the two or more selected universes.

The `search` tools were added and customised initially to check if a logo had already been added or not. \
There may be other potential uses and optimisations for the search tool.

The `cross` tool was added to make selecting 2 random logos and combining them together easier to do. \
It may also have a variety of potential uses and added features that have yet to be written.

You can add your own custom tools with their own unique names using the included Python script. \
An example of a tool you may want to add is a ""Dots on a Circle"" graph representing links between universes.

## Notes

The following ideas brought this repository into existence and are largely based on subtractive synthesis:

```
 * Start by adding .png images of every logo identity you can think of and keep adding to the dataset
 * Filter out certain images by either randomly or deliberately selecting them based on a pattern/distribution
 * Extrapolate and Analyse the contents and meanings of each selected image (perhaps also included in metadata)
 * Combine certain features of one selection with those of another to form a new overlapping idea (or ""crossover"")
 * Evaluate the new selection based on logical criteria derived from personal, ethical and human values
 * Make a decision on whether or not to take the new idea forward to be further refined or made into a product.
```

## WARNING: This tool is potentially very powerful. Please use it with care.

OpenStreetMap-Metaverse

This is English, well, kind of, as I am German.

Facebook/Meta announced THE Metaverse - as a place, anyone could join, but takes 50% of any payments There is no attempt to start an FOS Metaverse. This is partly a joke an the idea to make an OSM Metaverse.

The very first step will be to show a 3D Earth, generated by OSM tagging. The first solution to this is, to take the 3D Tiles from OSM2World.

It is done by Rust and (actually) by the grate ""bevy"", using ""wgpu"".

bevy is a game engine! A bit odd but it supports what is needed. Aseptically GPU instancing and (really now working) build to web/WASM.

Before, the crates ""rend3"" and ""tree-d"" were used. This decision may change any time! :-)

## Introduction

Unity 기반의 Multi-Play 가능한 Open World 게임이다. 서버는 node js에 mongoDB를 연결하여 만들었고 모델링에는 Blender를 사용하였다.

## Before Start

### Set Username

 게임 시작 전에 다른 유저들에게 보여질 자신의 이름을 설정할 수 있다. Player 아바타 위에 설정한 이름이 나타난다.

### Basic Motion Info

 `Up, Down, Left, Right` 또는 `W, A, S, D` 를 눌러 걸어다닐 수 있다. `Space` 를 누르면 점프한다.  카메라 시점은 마우스 움직임에 따라 자연스럽게 따라온다.

## Enjoy Game

### Hike Mountain

 맵에 있는 큰 산을 등산할 수 있다.
 <div align=center> <img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48681924/151151841-9a3730d4-2243-40df-a593-e85d94e60e31.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%""></div>

### Swim in Pond

맵에 있는 연못의 물과 접촉하면 수영 모션으로 바뀐다. 이동할 때는 평영 모션을 취하다 멈추면 수중에 떠 있는 모션으로 전환된다. 땅으로 나오게 되면 다시 걷는 모션으로 전환된다.
<div align=center> <img src = ""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48681924/151151820-b606f43a-f236-4093-b2c8-d5915506b10b.png"" width=""80%"" height=""80%""></div>

### Dance in Club

집 모양의 클럽으로 들어가면 플레이어 모션이 춤추는 모션으로 전환된다. 클럽 내의 NPC들과 같이 춤을 출 수 있다.

[![Deploy to now](https://deploy.now.sh/static/button.svg)](https://deploy.now.sh/?repo=https://github.com/michaltakac/aframe-next-static)

This boilerplate leverages extremely simple deployment flow from Zeit's Now, now available for WebVR with A-Frame and React!

### Libraries

- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io)
- [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react)
- [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

### Installation

To get started:

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
npm run dev
```

Development server now lives at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project uses static exporting feature from Next.js. If you wan't to build a Multiverse of multiple ""pages"" or ""routes"" (or should I say worlds?) and navigate through them, you need to provide a map of the routes in `next.config.js`. Read more info [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#static-html-export).

Note: Next.js is universal, which means it executes code first server-side, then client-side. The window object is only present client-side, so if you absolutely need to have access to it in some React component, you should put that code in `componentDidMount`. Check the `/pages/index.js` how we're doing it right now. You can load A-Frame-specific librabries like that. More info [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/FAQ#i-use-a-library-which-throws-window-is-undefined).

Deploy with ▲Now:

```bash
npm run deploy

=========

This is the metaworld repository, a proof of concept open internet like protocol for a collaborative 3D space build for the LIACS Multi-Media Systems class 2019-2020.

The metaworld consists of various components.
Each of these components has its own directory:

 - client

	 Contains the client program used to interact with the metaworld
 - dss

	Contains the Domain Space Server which manages space allocation between servers
 - common

	A Library containing utilities which are used through various components
 - server

	A library for building a metaworld server.
 - pong,test, and letters

	Contain a variety of metaworld servers which where used to test and showcase the implementation.
 - peerjs

    Contains a fork of the original peerjs library which was changed to allow it being packaged with browserify

building
--------

The various components have different build requirements.
For instructions on building a specific part see the RUNNING.md files in the directories.
However there are some general instructions for building metaworld.

### Requirements
All the metaworld components have the following requirements

- `nodejs`
- `npm`

Before trying to build any component one should always install the required
packages by running `npm install` in the directory of the component one is trying to build.

NOTE: this repository has a submodule so it should be cloned as following: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/DelSkayn/metaverse.git`

2022310315 소프트웨어학과 이용하

지원 동기: 저는 친구의 소개로 메타버스 동아리를 알게 되었습니다. 동방을 구경하려는 생각으로 잠깐 들린 것이었지만, 하루 동안 동방 생활을 하면서 동아리가 굉장히 매력적이라고 생각했습니다. 선배들의 유익한 조언, 상호적 소통을 통한 공부, 친목 활동까지 동아리에 꼭 들어가고 싶다는 생각이 들었습니다. 무엇보다 대부분 소프트웨어학과로 이루어진 이 동아리를 통해 나의 실력도 기르면서 그러 길러진 실력을 통해 동아리 실적에 기여하고 싶다고 생각했습니다.

개발 경력: 파이썬, C, C++, C# 언어를 학습하였습니다. 고등학교 공도 교육 과정을 통해 C언어로 TextRpg게임, Text슈팅게임을 개발한 이력이 있습니다. 고등학교 물리 프로그래밍 동아리 회장으로써 파이썬 기반으로 한 Vpython 모듈을 통해 중력, 케플러 운동, 진자 운동, 등속원운동, 이상 기체 운동 등 다양한 물리 시뮬레이션을 구현해봤습니다. 안드로이드 스튜디오를 이용해 학교 어플리케이션 개발을 한 적이 있으며, MIT App Inventor를 통해 정보 격차 해소를 위한 정보 집약 앱, 디지털 리터러시 향상을 위한 스마트폰 학습 앱을 개발한 이력이 있습니다. pygame을 이용해 스네이크 게임을 공동 개발해봤습니다.

스튜디오에게 바라는 점: 앞으로도 동아리 패밀리들과 함께 성장하고 동아리 진전을 위해 힘냅시다 !!!!!

메타버스 사랑합니다.

SmartDev210/metaverse-nft,Solidity,"# NFT Contracts by Buildship

This is a collection of smart-contracts that help you to launch your own 10k-avatar collection like [CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks), [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/) or [Pudgy Penguins](https://www.pudgypenguins.io/).


USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Most of the features are in production already, however this doesn't guarantee any security. Unreleased and speculative code is located in `contracts/experiments` directory.

Features include:

## MetaverseNFT.sol
- Limited supply
- Mint N tokens in one transaction
- Generative art
- Lazy Mint – buyers pays for mint
- Manually start/stop sale
- Reserve X tokens for team or community
- Deployed by Factory using Clones
- Supports `NFTExtension` to upgrade mint and tokenURI functions

## MetaverseBaseNFT.sol
- Same features as MetaverseNFT
- Import and inherit in your own projects

```solidity
contract MyPFPNFT is MetaverseBaseNFT {

    constructor() MetaverseBaseNFT(
        0.1 ether, // public mint price, you can change later
        10000, // total supply
        100, // reserved
        20, // max mint per transaction
        0, // royalty fee
        ""ipfs://Qm/"", // baseURI
        ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"", 
        ""BAYC"",
        false // should start at 1 or at 0?
    ) {}

}
```

## NFTExtension
- Can be added to main NFT using `addExtension`
- Support changing mint and tokenURI functions

## How to use:

### Init

```bash
npm i
touch .mnemonic
node scripts/generate_mnemonic.mjs
vim .mnemonic # input generated mnemonic

cp .env.example .env
vim .env # input your keys
```

### Development

When you change something, run:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Then, to test your code:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to production

You can deploy using Hardhat. Refer to Hardhat scripts and console guides for deployment.
https://hardhat.org/guides/deploying.html

However, we also support deploying with your Metamask:

### Upload to IPFS for Frontend Deploy

Instead of deploying from your local machine, you can compile and send it for deployment from  the Buildship web app.

```bash
hh upload contracts/Greeter.sol --args '""hello"",""bar""'
```

It needs network selection to run, but it doesn't matter which you use. You can run with development network.

flookkyz/MetaverseXr-Land,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

[![Deploy to now](https://deploy.now.sh/static/button.svg)](https://deploy.now.sh/?repo=https://github.com/michaltakac/aframe-next-static)

This boilerplate leverages extremely simple deployment flow from Zeit's Now, now available for WebVR with A-Frame and React!

### Libraries

- [A-Frame](https://aframe.io)
- [aframe-react](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-react)
- [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

### Installation

To get started:

```bash
npm install # or yarn install
npm run dev
```

Development server now lives at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project uses static exporting feature from Next.js. If you wan't to build a Multiverse of multiple ""pages"" or ""routes"" (or should I say worlds?) and navigate through them, you need to provide a map of the routes in `next.config.js`. Read more info [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js#static-html-export).

Note: Next.js is universal, which means it executes code first server-side, then client-side. The window object is only present client-side, so if you absolutely need to have access to it in some React component, you should put that code in `componentDidMount`. Check the `/pages/index.js` how we're doing it right now. You can load A-Frame-specific librabries like that. More info [here](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/wiki/FAQ#i-use-a-library-which-throws-window-is-undefined).

Deploy with ▲Now:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

=========

This is the metaworld repository, a proof of concept open internet like protocol for a collaborative 3D space build for the LIACS Multi-Media Systems class 2019-2020.

The metaworld consists of various components.
Each of these components has its own directory:

 - client

	 Contains the client program used to interact with the metaworld
 - dss

	Contains the Domain Space Server which manages space allocation between servers
 - common

	A Library containing utilities which are used through various components
 - server

	A library for building a metaworld server.
 - pong,test, and letters

	Contain a variety of metaworld servers which where used to test and showcase the implementation.
 - peerjs

    Contains a fork of the original peerjs library which was changed to allow it being packaged with browserify

building
--------

The various components have different build requirements.
For instructions on building a specific part see the RUNNING.md files in the directories.
However there are some general instructions for building metaworld.

### Requirements
All the metaworld components have the following requirements

- `nodejs`
- `npm`

Before trying to build any component one should always install the required
packages by running `npm install` in the directory of the component one is trying to build.

NOTE: this repository has a submodule so it should be cloned as following: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/DelSkayn/metaverse.git`

2022310315 소프트웨어학과 이용하

지원 동기: 저는 친구의 소개로 메타버스 동아리를 알게 되었습니다. 동방을 구경하려는 생각으로 잠깐 들린 것이었지만, 하루 동안 동방 생활을 하면서 동아리가 굉장히 매력적이라고 생각했습니다. 선배들의 유익한 조언, 상호적 소통을 통한 공부, 친목 활동까지 동아리에 꼭 들어가고 싶다는 생각이 들었습니다. 무엇보다 대부분 소프트웨어학과로 이루어진 이 동아리를 통해 나의 실력도 기르면서 그러 길러진 실력을 통해 동아리 실적에 기여하고 싶다고 생각했습니다.

개발 경력: 파이썬, C, C++, C# 언어를 학습하였습니다. 고등학교 공도 교육 과정을 통해 C언어로 TextRpg게임, Text슈팅게임을 개발한 이력이 있습니다. 고등학교 물리 프로그래밍 동아리 회장으로써 파이썬 기반으로 한 Vpython 모듈을 통해 중력, 케플러 운동, 진자 운동, 등속원운동, 이상 기체 운동 등 다양한 물리 시뮬레이션을 구현해봤습니다. 안드로이드 스튜디오를 이용해 학교 어플리케이션 개발을 한 적이 있으며, MIT App Inventor를 통해 정보 격차 해소를 위한 정보 집약 앱, 디지털 리터러시 향상을 위한 스마트폰 학습 앱을 개발한 이력이 있습니다. pygame을 이용해 스네이크 게임을 공동 개발해봤습니다.

스튜디오에게 바라는 점: 앞으로도 동아리 패밀리들과 함께 성장하고 동아리 진전을 위해 힘냅시다 !!!!!

메타버스 사랑합니다.

"
LeeHoanMinh/Metaverse,C#,"# Unity + Git + Git LFS

This is a tutorial & template for setting up Unity + Git + Git Large File Storage (LFS). 

There are a couple of challenges when it comes to using git (or version control software in general) with Unity:

- Binary assets - commit history, merge conflicts, etc. are near impossible for a human to read. We can solve this by serializing assets, e.g. turning Unity scenes into a text format.
- Large files (large 3D models, big spritesheets, etc.) - GitHub warns you at 50mb and caps you at 100mb. We can solve this with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Setup

The initial setup for a project requires a few steps, but you only have to do it once per project. To set up a Unity project with Git and Git LFS:

### Preparing your Computer

- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
- Install the required software on your machine:
  - [Unity](https://unity.com/).
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
  - [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com).
  - If you are in the IAM labs/classrooms, these should be installed. You may need to open the software center to activate GitHub Desktop.
- Open up GitHub Desktop and login in with your GitHub account.

### Creating the Repository

You can watch a video of this process [here](https://colum2.instructuremedia.com/embed/de36691b-707a-4877-910c-e25b0f0d45aa), or follow along below:

- Create a new repository for your project from GitHub Desktop:
  - `File > New Repository` or `CTRL + N`.
  - Give it a name and choose the local path where it will be created. (If you are in an IAM lab/classroom, do NOT put it on the network home drive AKA z drive.)
- Add the .gitignore and .gitattributes:
  - [Download the files](https://github.com/mikewesthad/unity-git-and-lfs/archive/master.zip) from this repo.
  - Unzip the files and copy over the .gitignore and .gitattributes files to your git repository.
  - Create a commit from GitHub Desktop with those two files.
  - It's important that you do this step first before adding any Unity project files.
- Set up Git LFS:
  - Navigate to your repository and run `git lfs install` in your command prompt/terminal. If you have your repository selected in GitHub Desktop, you can click `Repository > Open in Command Prompt` from the toolbar to open up a terminal window. Type in `git lfs install` and hit enter. You should see a message like ""Git LFS initialized"".
- Add your Unity project to the repository:
  - Create a new Unity project or grab an existing project.
  - Open up your Unity project folder in file explorer/finder. It's the folder that contains ""Assets/"", ""ProjectSettings/"", ""Packages/"", etc. In other words, select the folder one directory up from ""Assets/"". One quick way to get there from Unity, right click on ""Assets"" in your Project window and select ""Show in Explorer"".
  - Copy all the contents of your project folder into your repository (e.g. ""Assets/"", ""ProjectSettings/"", etc.).
- Make a commit of the project:
  - Head back to GitHub desktop.
  - Select your files and make a commit.
- Publish your repository:
  - Head to GitHub Desktop and select your repository.
  - Click the ""Publish repository"" button near the top of the screen.
  - If you are creating this repository for a project in class, uncheck ""Keep this code private"".
  - Click ""Publish repository"".
  - Whew! It's live now. You go straight to where it is stored on GitHub via `Repository > View on GitHub` in the GitHub Desktop toolbar.

Now that the repository is all set up, you can simply commit and push/pull as you work on the project! Make sure to always commit and sync before leaving the lab.

## Cloning the Repository Elsewhere

Now that you've got this Unity project on GitHub, you can ""clone"" it to a new computer:

- Make sure you have GitHub Desktop + Git LFS + Unity on the computer.
- Open GitHub Desktop and log in.
- Click on `File => Clone Repository..."" (or CTRL + SHIFT + O). Choose the repository and the local path where it should be cloned on the computer.
- GitHub Desktop may prompt you to install Git LFS. If it does, allow it. If it doesn't, repeat the process from the previous section where we ran `git lfs install` from a terminal window.

## Notes

One thing to note, the free plan of Git LFS comes with 1g of storage total and 1g of bandwidth per billing cycle/month. Anything you push/pull from LFS counts against that. You can see your current usage under `Settings > Billing`.

  It is supposed to be testing my smart contracts such as my transfers, minting, and deployment and then say ""14 passing"", but I am not sure what went wrong..
I put my smart contracts in here that I created land.test.js and Land.sol.. if you guys could give it a look that'd be great.

Spectruth/Metaverse,,
NicholasNikas/metaverse,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

</p>

This framework is based on the DataHub ingestion architecture which _""supports an extremely flexible ingestion architecture that can support push, pull, asynchronous and synchronous models""_. For the time being, this Framework only supports aynchrounous communication. 

For a deep dive into metadata ingestion architectures, check out [this](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/datahub-popular-metadata-architectures-explained) awesome artice by Shirshanka Das from Linkedin.

## Deploy to Azure

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure subscription with `Contributor` access.
- Latest version of [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (getting started guide [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/azure-get-started))

⚠️ The schema module introduces dependencies on Bash and Curl. Windows users may need to use WSL or Docker. This will be resolved when the Terraform AzureRM provider introduces support for the Azure Schema Registry ⚠️



```bash
az login
terraform init
terraform apply
```

![](docs/img/deployment.png)

## Ingest Metadata
Developers are encouraged to write plugins to integrate with various data sources. The `plugins/example` directory contains example code that can be used as a starting point for writing a plugin. This example follows the [sidecar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) pattern.

At a high level, a plugin is reponsible for:
- Capturing metadata changes
- Modelling the metadata using the Schema Registry
- Emitting mettadata events

**To get started:**
- Install Docker
- Install Az CLI

Next, run the following snippet. The example code will send a mock Metadata Event to the Metaverse api.

Execution is succesful when `MCE Published` is printed to the console. 

```bash
az login
export CONNECTION_STRING=$(az eventhubs \
    namespace authorization-rule keys list \
    --resource-group rg-metaverse-resources \
    --namespace-name ehns-metaverse \
    --name RootManageSharedAccessKey \
    --query primaryConnectionString \
    --out tsv)

export EVENTHUB=eh-metaverse

docker run -it \
    --env CONNECTION_STRING=""$CONNECTION_STRING"" \
    --env RESOURCE_GORUP=""$RESOURCE_GORUP"" \
    $(docker build -q .)
```

# Architecture

The below diagram best illistrates how the framework operates. The left side shows how the internal components interact, the right is how a Metadata Management system might consume and produce metadata events. 

![](docs/img/arch.png)

1. Metadata producers retrieve a schema from the Schema Service. 
This serves as a contract which allows both producing an consuming applications to evolve independently. 
2. Metadata producers emit metrics which are serialised using this shared schema. These events recieved by the Event Streaming service.
3. Matadata events are persisted to the Object Storage service where they are retained indefinately.

### Context Diagram
The context diagram shows how this system fits into the world around it. See [c4model.com](https://c4model.com/)

<img src=""docs/img/arch_context.png""  width=""400""/>

## Architecture Decisions
The `docs/architecture` directory contains lightweight architecture decision records (ADR). The understand ADRs, see [this](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) blog post. 

For examples, check out [this](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/tree/master/docs/architecture/decisions) repo.

--> As the name suggests, a social media application is a web application that allows users to share content with other users.

# Lets take a look in what features a social media application have ? -->

  -- Pagination
  -- Search and Filter Functionality
  -- It will include client-side-routing / Details page.
  -- It will be a fully functioning CRUD application.
  -- It will have a user authentication system.

# Auth or Authentication is a complex process so lets take a look into it too..

--> Authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they say they are.
--> We are going to allow our user to register or login in our database.
--> We will provide 2 sign in options. Either Sign in with your email or sign in with your google id.
--> We will also provide a forgot password option.
--> We will use JWT and Google OAuth.

# At last we will add a comments section.

# And refactor the User Interface and make it fully responsive.

# MERN Stack:- 
        - MERN Stack is a JavaScript stack used for easier and faster deployment of full stack web applications.
        - It is a combination of the following technologies:
            - MongoDB (M) :- It is a NoSQL database.
            - Express (E) :- It is a web application framework for Node.js.
            - React   (R) :- It is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            - Node.js (N) :- It is a JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.

# Last but not the Least WE WILL DEPLOY OUR APPLICATION TO HEROKU.

# Lets first set our folder structure and directly dive into the code :-

  -- First we are going to create a new folder for the project.
  -- Open the folder in your desired code editor
  -- Create two folders in the parent directory named as follows:- 
        - client
        - server
  -- Set up a new react app in the client folder by using the following command:- 
        - npx create-react-app ./ OR yarn create react-app ./
  -- Till our React App is initialized lets create a index.js file in the server directory.
  -- In a second terminal open the server folder and initialize a ""package.json"" file by writing the following command:- 
        - npm init -y
  -- Now we will install the following packages in the package.json file:-
       - ""body-parser"" :- It will help us to send post requests.
       - ""cors"" :- It will help us to send requests from different domains.
       - ""express"" :- It will help us to create a server.
       - ""mongoose"" :- It will help us to connect to the database.
       - ""nodemon"" :- It will help us to restart the server when we make changes in the code.
       # To install you can run the following command in the terminal:-
          - npm install body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon 
          - This should add all the dependencies in the package.json file.
  -- We can go to index.js file and import the required dependencies.
  -- In the newest versions of node.js we can use the ""import"" statement for the imports. We can allow our app to do by just adding a ""type"" in the package.json file, like so - ""type"":""module""
  
  -- Now when we are in the package.json file just add some scripts for more convinience :- 
      - ""start"": ""node index.js"",
        ""dev"": ""nodemon index.js"",
  -- Lets install all the dependencies of same versions in our client side as well:- 
      - ""@material-ui/core"" :- It will help us to create the Material UI components.
      - ""@material-ui/icons"" :- It will help us to create the Material UI icons.
      - ""@material-ui/lab"" :- It will help us to create the Material UI components.
      - ""axios"" :- It will help us to make requests to the server.
      - ""jwt-decode"" :- It will help us to decode the JWT token.
      - ""material-ui-chip-input"" :- It will help us to create the Material UI chips.
      - ""moment"" :- A lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
      - ""react-file-base64"" :- It will help us to upload images to the server.
      - ""react-google-login"" :- It will help us to create the google login button.
      - ""react-redux"" :- It will help us to create the redux store.
      - ""react-router-dom"" :- It will help us to create the react router.
      - ""redux"" :- It will help us to create the redux store.
      - ""redux-thunk"" :- It will help us to create the redux thunk.
      - To download or add these dependencies you need to run the following command in your terminal:- 
           -- npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab axios jwt-decode material-ui-chip-input moment react-file-base64 react-google-login react-redux react-router-dom redux redux-thunk

  -- Add the package.json in the client after the dependencies are added.

  -- Lets take a look in the app that create-react-app made for us.
  -- In the directory we can see that there is a folder named ""src"". Delete it !!
  -- Create a new folder with the same name.
  -- Inside that folder create two files named as follows:- 
           1. index.js
           2. App.js
  -- In the App.js file initialize a functional component using the shortcut ""rafce"".
  -- In the index.js file just paste the following code:- 
           --> import React from ""react"";
               import * as ReactDOMClient from ""react-dom/client"";
               import App from ""./App"";

               const container = document.getElementById(""root"")

               const root = ReactDOMClient.createRoot(container);

                ) 
  -- Lets now just start our react app and lets check whether we have done everything properly or not ?
  -- To start your application run the following command in your terminal:- 
         - npm start OR yarn start
  -- If you have done everything properly you must see compiled successfully.

# Lets Just Close everything and start with our Server side coding because it has more thing to do init.

-- Initialize the app in the index.js file.
-- Use all the necessary dependencies and then start with the database connection.
-- For this we are gonna use MongoDB Atlas Cloud Database.
-- Just visit their official website and create a new shared free cluster or database for your application.
-- After that you will get a cluster name and a database name.
-- Lets connect the database with our application.
-- Create a connection uri variable and paste the connection string.
-- Then just use the mongoose.connect function to coneect to the database.
-- At last add a .then function which will help us to perform some functions after the connection of the database is established.
-- When everything is set up properly then your server side index.js file should look like this:-
            import  express  from ""express"";
            import bodyParser from ""body-parser"";
            import mongoose from ""mongoose"";
            import cors from ""cors"";
            import postRoutes from ""./routes/posts.js""

            const app = express();

            app.use('/posts',postRoutes);

            app.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: ""30mb"", extended: ""true"" }));
            app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: ""30mb"", extended: ""true"" }));
            app.use(cors());

            //Connecting to mongoDB Atlas 

            const CONNECTION_URI =
            ""mongodb+srv://admin:admin@cluster0.cv40z.mongodb.net/metaverse?retryWrites=true&w=majority"";

            const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

            mongoose.connect(CONNECTION_URI, {
                useNewUrlParser: true,
                useUnifiedTopology: true,
            }).then(()=> app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server Running on http://localhost:${PORT}`) )).catch((err)=> console.log(err.message));

-- When its look the same then just start your server by using the command ""npm run dev"" in our terminal.
-- And if everything is working fine then you should see the server running on http://localhost:5000.
-- Lets create our first route of the application.
-- To do so Lets create a folder named ""routes"" in the server folder. In the routes folder create a file named posts.js which will include all the routes regarding the posts of our social media application.
-- In the posts.js file create a route and export the router, after that just import the router in the index.js file and use it by writing ""app.use('/posts',postRoutes)"".
-- And if everything goes fine then you must see a response in your browser when you hit the url you made the route for.
# Lets set up the folder structure in our server folder
-- Create a folder named ""Controllers"" for the functions that will run in the specific routes.
-- Inside of the controllers set up a basic controller for the route we are gonna use in our application.
-- After that just import the controller in routes folder in the posts.js file and use it in the specific route and test your route.
-- Create a folder named ""Models"" for the models that will be used in the application.
-- Inside the Models folder create the model using ""mongoose"" and its createSchema function.
-- After that just create the routes for the application. Like I made in the starting getPosts and createPosts functions for the routes for getting and creating posts.
-- And if everything goes fine then you must see a response in your browser when you hit the url you made the route for.
-- Then lets get the req.body from the frontend and send it to the backend.

# Come back to the client folder and set up a folder structure like so :- 
-- Create a folder named components in the src folder.
-- Inside of the components folder create two folders named ""Forms"" and ""Posts"". Inside of both the folders create a seperate component file and styles file respectively.
-- Inside of the Posts folder create another folder named ""Post"" and create a component file and styles file respectively.
-- Your Folder Structure of ""src"" folder should look like :- 
            .
            ├── App.js
            ├── components
            │   ├── Forms
            │   │   ├── Forms.jsx

            │       └── styles.js
            └── index.js
# Lets start Coding stuff in the files that we created in the components folder.

# Just do everything synchronously like at first implement a logic in the backend and rather testing it in a third party software test it in the frontend.

# In linking both the client and server we need to make use of axios and Redux store.

# To do so create three folders named ""api"", ""actions"", ""reducers"" respectively.

# api folder:- It will hold all the axios requests send to the backend and yeah I forgot to tell so that you must add a proxy in your react app by adding a proxy detail in the package.json file like so :- ""proxy"": ""http://localhost:5000""

# actions folder:- It will hold all the actions that will be used in the application for the CRUD operations.

# reducers folder:- It will hold all the reducers that will be used in the application for the CRUD operations.

# Add functionality to all the buttons and then use the axios request to hit the backend and fetch data from it."

###### tags: `fund`

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/RoZWsipiSDKNDy1CyIqifQ/badge)](https://hackmd.io/RoZWsipiSDKNDy1CyIqifQ)

###### Note: This project is on hold. If you would like to assist or help lead this effort please reach out. People care about the problem we are hoping to solve, but it would need more effort than we can currently provide. Ideally, we can resume this in the near future, but we don't want to bottleneck this effort. Cheers, and let's make the Metaverse open, together. 

The Metaverse Association is a traditional non-profit foundation that funds open metaverse project    s, and collaborates with web3 and web2 communities.

We believe the open metaverse represents one of the largest social changes that will happen in our lifetime. It is imperative that it is open, interoperable, and that the foundational principles target positive outcomes for society. 

There is a massive gap in our industry related to funding sources for Open Metaverse creators. Many open metaverse creators creating critical infrastructure lack a current path to revenue, and we don't want them to fizzle out. While we recognize that blockchain is an important component of the open metaverse, it is not all inclusive. In order to represent all of the critical needs of the Metaverse, funding access should be open and accessible by anyone. 

It is our belief that the open Metaverse is dependent on collaboration. We do not aspire to be a single institution, but actually work alongside the different stakeholders, because we all ultimately share the same vision. 

## Getting Involved 

This is a new repo, meant to serve as a clean slate. We rally around [milestones](https://github.com/Metaverse-Association/fund/milestones), and [feedback discussions](https://github.com/Metaverse-Association/feedback/discussions) Let's shape this association together, as a collective. We don't know what we don't know, and hope you'll help us make this group impactful and collaborative. For now, we have adopted the [OMI Github Strategy](https://hackmd.io/@mrmetaverse/omi-github-process) which once ratified as a group, we can create our own. 

## Getting Funded 

We are a new org, but we hope to serve the Metaverse quickly. We want to support people building for an Open and Interoperable Metaverse. To submit a funding request for review, please review: [Our Guidelines: What we are looking to fund]() for more information for how to qualify. More information about when, and how to come. 

## Raising Funds 

We opted to start as a traditional non-profit foundation. We believe that open metaverse creators deserve a chance to build out the critical infrastructure necessary for a more collaborative and open metaverse. We don't believe that should solely be driven by immediate profitability. We all benefit from interoperability and the open metaverse. That is why we intend to create avenues for traditional funds to get involved with supporting these projects. We intend to roll out new orgs and services in the future to help creators with a path to profitability scale as needed, and to help those without a path to profitability to succeed as intended. The metaverse is bigger than one org. 

## What we are not 

The Metaverse Association is not a DAO. We are not owned by a larger corp, nor are we a standards body. While we work well with these other groups, the Metaverse Association is strictly intended to serve as a more traditional non-profit issuing grants for the open metaverse.

kaoskorobase/metaverse1-soundscape-rendering,SuperCollider,"# Metaverse1 soundscape rendering system

[Metaverse1](http://www.metaverse1.org/) was a three year ITEA2 research project, carried out between 2008 and 2011. The project goal was the creation of standards for the interaction between virtual worlds and the real world and the project culminated in the creation of the MPEG-V standard.

This repository contains code and documentation for the soundscape rendering application developed at the [Music Technology Group](http://mtg.upf.edu) for a virtual tourism use case within the Metaverse1 project. The soundscape rendering application was developed in SuperCollider, and the audio streaming server was programmed in Twisted/Python.

The system is a soundscape composition and rendering environment based on a generative graph based model of sound concepts. The code is provided mostly for archival and documentation purposes, in case it is interesting and useful for someone.

Documentation is scarce; if you have any questions or suggestions, please submit an issue in our issue tracker!

## Documentation

General project documentation, a demo video and a list of related publications can be found [on the MTG website](http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/soundscapes). Additionally, there is some developer and user documentation in the [doc](/doc) directory.

# Introdução

A realidade virtual é uma ferramenta com bastante potencial para ser empregada no ensino de ciências, despertando o interesse de alunos por fenômenos que muitas vezes são representados de forma abstrata e não são fáceis de serem visualizados. No campo da Biologia não é diferente, tendo aplicações práticas desde cirurgias já realizadas com realidade aumentada, até o auxílio na aprendizagem através de modelos anatômicos 3D[1]. Ainda falando sobre a realidade virtual, o uso da tecnologia já é uma realidade em museus de todo o mundo, trazendo uma experiência ainda mais detalhista e enriquecedora para seus visitantes. Em Salvador, o Espaço Pierre Verger da Fotografia Baiana (Forte de Sta. Maria), traz diversas exposições que aconteceram ou que foram criadas especificamente para visitação através de Óculos de Realidade Virtual[2]. Mostras de Pierre Verger, Adenor Gondim e Hirosuke Kitamura, foram as primeiras a serem disponibilizadas ao público. Nesse contexto, surge a ideia do museu de cera da anatomia humana. Um espaço interativo que se propõe a utilizar a realidade virtual para trazer uma experiência realista a crianças de 6-10 anos que ainda estão tendo o seu primeiro contato com os órgãos do corpo humano, ajudando a despertar mais interesse e retratar de forma mais realista e potencializando o aprendizado.
A ideia é um aplicativo multiplataforma que não precisa de equipamentos de hardware sofisticados para ser utilizado. Um óculos VR Cardboard de papelão(Figura 1), que pode ser feito com o próprio smartphone ou adquirido por até R$ 20.00 nas lojas de varejo online[3], é suficiente para a experiência de imersão no museu. O museu conta com um acervo de 9 peças realistas da anatomia humana, das quais se destacam a reprodução do cérebro humano, detalhes do esqueleto dentre outros. O tour virtual foi pensado como uma experiência de imersão, sendo também possível utilizar seus óculos RV para visualizar outras perspectivas do ambiente.

# Técnicas Aplicadas

O museu foi construído utilizando o three.js[4], uma biblioteca JavaScript apoiada no WebGL que é bastante utilizada para criar e modelar objetos 3D e animações em um navegador web. A ferramenta foi escolhida pois além de ser open-source e ter uma boa documentação, tem suporte para o Webxr, permitindo a integração com o metaverso.

**1) Modelagem do Ambiente**

Para a construção do teto e do piso do nosso ambiente utilizamos duas instâncias do objeto do tipo THREE.PlaneGeometry, definindo o tamanho, rotacionando, transladando e adicionando cores nas posições dessa geometria. Carregamos uma textura e adicionamos a um THREE.MeshPhongMaterial e posteriormente adicionando a nossa cena um objeto do tipo THREE.Mesh, que foi instanciado passando essa geometria e o seu material.
Criamos uma matriz para definir em quais posições teríamos paredes, janelas ou a base utilizada para posicionarmos os órgãos. Para a criação das paredes, adicionamos à cena um THREE.Mesh composto por um THREE.BoxGeometry e um THREE.MeshPhongMaterial, carregando uma textura de mármore. Já para a criação das bases, adicionamos um THREE.Mesh composto por um THREE.BoxGeometry e um THREE.MeshPhongMaterial, carregando uma textura metalizada. Na criação das janelas adicionamos um THREE.Mesh composto por um  THREE.BoxGeometry e utilizamos um THREE.MeshBasicMaterial de cor ciano, transparente e opacidade baixa. A construção em formato de matriz foi escolhida pela versatilidade de adequação ao longo do projeto.

**2) Modelagem dos Órgãos**

Os orgãos foram adicionados através de modelos disponibilizados de forma gratuita no formato GLTF em plataformas como o Sketchfab[5]. A escolha de trabalhar prioritariamente com modelos do tipo GLTF foi por conta da simplicidade e da maior disponibilidade destes em relação aos OBJ. Com o cenário já construido, foi possível modificar a escala e a posição de cada órgão para dimensionar de forma real dentro do museu.

**3) Modelagem do Cenário**

Os objetos que compõem o cenário também foram adicionados através de modelos disponibilizados gratuitamente em formato GLTF em plataformas como o Sketchfab. Com o cenário já construído, adicionamos todos os objetos através de uma instância de um objeto do tipo GLTFLoader, no qual passamos o caminho do modelo baixado em nosso projeto e uma função para definirmos a posição, tamanho, nome e posteriormente a adição à cena. O GLTFLoader foi constrúido para evitar redundância no código.

**4) Iluminação da Cena**

Para a iluminação da cena do nosso projeto, adicionamos uma luz ambiente e três pontos de luz, duas posicionadas no lustre adicionado no teto do cenário e uma posicionada em uma luminária em cima da mesa. Para a luz ambiente instanciamos um objeto do tipo THREE.AmbientLight e para os pontos de luz adicionais, três instâncias de objetos do tipo THREE.PointLight. A escolha da iluminação do tipo THREE.PointLight, como o próprio nome diz, por ser um ponto de luz, assim podemos posicionar cada ponto estrategicamente para que cause a impressão de ser uma luz proveniente dos objetos citados acima, e por podermos definir/modificar a distância, decaimento e intensidade da iluminação.

**5) Integração com o Webxr - Realidade Virtual**

O WebXR[6] foi a ferramenta utilizada para que fosse possivel exibir o cenário do museu através do navegador, simulando a utilização de um dispositivo físico como por exemplo um óculos Cardboad, através da instalação de um plugin no browser. 

Através do Threejs, foi necessário importar o VRButton que é um botão que verifica se existe compatibilidade com VR e que caso a mesma exista, é através deste que a experiencia em VR é iniciada. No nosso museu, o tour também é iniciado dessa forma. Para isso, foi necessário ajustar também no código na função responsável pela animação, utilizando setAnimationLoop pois o mesmo é necessário para projetos com WebXR, além de ativar a flag de renderização XR.

A experiência de realidade virtual é uma imersão no metaverso através de um caminho predefinido que a câmera percorre no museu. Para isso, adicionamos ela a um grupo(THREE.Group) e construímos uma elipse que vai ser o caminho percorrido pela câmera em cada ciclo da animação. Durante o tour, é possível utilizar os óculos de realidade virtual para observar em qualquer direção do ambiente. A escolha por uma interação visual se deu por conta do custo do equipamento exigido para outras formas de interação utilizando os controles, além do tempo reduzido de aproximadamente 15 dias para entregar o projeto piloto 100% funcional.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

JustaLiang/HappyApeCommunity,TypeScript,"# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/sample-script.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS ""Hello, Hardhat!""
```

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).

# Introduction
Metaverse(MVS) is a decentralised system based on the blockchain technology, through which, a network of smart properties, digital identities and value intermediators are established.

**Metaverse Features**:
- [Digital Assets Register/Transfering](http://docs.mvs.org/whitepaper/index.html)
- [Digital Identity](http://docs.mvs.org/whitepaper/digital-identity.html)
- Oralces
- Decentralized Exchange

# Building MVS

## Compiler requirements
| Compilier | Minimum Version | Recommanded Version |
| ---------| ---------------- | ------------------- |
| gcc/g++ |   5.0             | 9.0.0+  |
| clang++ |   3.4 (8.0.0)     | 10.0.0+ |
| MSVC    |   19.0 (VS2015)   | VS2019  |

C++ compiler support [C++14](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support) standard or newer.
Dependencies of MVS binaris are **static linked** (including libstdc++).

## Toolchain requirements
- cmake 3.0+
- git
- automake (speck256k1/ZeroMQ)

```bash
$ yum/brew/apt-get install git cmake
$ yum/brew/apt-get install autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
```


# Setup Library Dependencies

## By install_dependencies.sh
Installing `ZeroMQ` `secp256k1` automatically by:
```bash
$ sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
```
Installing `boost` `upnp` automatically by:
```bash
$ sudo ./install_dependencies.sh --build-boost --build-upnpc
```
## Manually
### boost 1.56+
```bash
$ sudo yum/brew/apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
[Download Boost 1.69.0](https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.69.0/source/boost_1_69_0.tar.gz).

## zeromq 4.2.1+
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/download/v4.2.1/zeromq-4.2.1.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf zeromq-4.2.1.tar.gz
$ cd zeromq-4.2.1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
```
`server/explorer` requires ZeroMQ.

## secp256k1 
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/secp256k1
$ cd secp256k1
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-module-recovery
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install && sudo ldconfig
```

Sometimes we may got the following compile error `undefined reference to '__gmpn_sub_n' ...`
See more details here [#issue209](https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse/issues/209)
```
$ ./configure --enable-module-recovery --with-bignum=no
```

## miniupnpc
```bash
$ wget http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/miniupnpc-2.0.tar.gz
$ tar -xzvf miniupnpc-2.0.tar.gz
$ cd miniupnpc-2.0
$ make -j4
$ sudo INSTALLPREFIX=/usr/local make install && sudo ldconfig
```
`blockchain/network` requires upnp if specified.

# Building
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse.git
$ cd metaverse && mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DUSE_UPNP=OFF ..
$ make -j4
$ make install
```
To enable UPnP, use `cmake ..` instead.

optional:
```bash
$ make test (should install boost_unit_test_framework)
$ make doc  (should install doxygen and graphviz)
```

# Run it
 - **mvsd** - server program  
   Runs a full metaverse node in the global peer-to-peer network.

 - **mvs-cli** - client program  
   Sent your request to the server, the server will process it and return response to your client.

```bash
$ cd bin
$ ./mvsd
$ ./mvs-cli
$ ./mvs-cli getnewaccount -h
$ ./mvs-cli $command $params $options
```
Read More [Command line usage](https://docs.mvs.org/docs/command-line.html) and [Configuration file](https://docs.mvs.org/docs/config-file.html).

# Building/Run under docker

## Preparation
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
```
wget qO https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

## Build metaverse image
```
git clone https://github.com/mvs-org/metaverse.git
cd metaverse
docker build -t metaverse -f Dockerfile .
```

Where is your built image? It’s in your machine’s local Docker image registry:
```bash
docker images
```

## Run && Test

### Start docker container
```bash
docker run -p 8820:8820 metaverse
```

### Test
```bash
curl -X POST --data '{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""method"":""getinfo"",""params"":[],""id"":25}' http://127.0.0.1:8820/rpc/v2
```

### Execute mvs-cli commands
Run `mvs-cli` commands via `docker exec` command. Example:
```bash
docker exec metaverse mvs-cli getinfo
```

# Build for raspberry pi

Cross compile mvs using Docker in ubuntu 16.04

you need to change to **root** when executing the flowing command.

## env

check versin first, linux kerne and docker version:

```
host docker >= 17.05.0-ce
host kernel >= 4.8
```

install qemu:

```
apt-get install qemu-user-static
```

## way1

Clone the mvs source.
then enter mvs source directory, then run:

```
// for arm 64 (eg: aarch64, armv8(and abover))
sudo bash ./cross-build.sh arm64
```

When everything ok, the binary file and .so/.a file will be found in output directory.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

PapaSmurf/metaverse,,"# metaverse
A system for living in a metaverse. It is described by using models, metaphors, and physics as best we can understand and imagine. The metaverse hosts any and all vendors and users of all kinds; we do not discriminate between augmented and virtual reality users, providers, content developers, advertisers, for-profit or non-profit, and so on. Within the metaverse there is a universe for you. Or several. 
The Metaverse is a multiverse comprised of real, imaginary, and augmented universes. It is a platform that is open to all vendors, and is the future of extended reality. Obviously, it will take a ton of code, and coordination of many big-name sponsors, but the time is right for this to come into being.
We need a lot of help, and if successful, hope to reward our contributors accordingly. As a developer, your code has to conform to our PEP coding style and practices. We are going to use open source languages in our layers:
     At the persistence layer we will use relational (MySQL) and document-oriented (Mongodb) databases. 
     At the persistence interface layer, we use SQLAlchemy https://www.sqlalchemy.org/ to objectify our data
     At the API Layer, we use Python 3 with built-in test cases following the MVC pattern
     For the XR/AR presentation we will need to rely on each vendor's specifications for sending the model to the glasses
     For the web presentation we will use JavaScript, specifically the Angular library and Data-Driven Document (D3) libraries (along with a python-driven web server) 
     For a native presentation, we will use Blender as a seamless way to create, edit, and submit content. 
     For the commerce layer, we have yet to select a platform although we know it must support secure wallets, cryptocurrencies in the US, taxation where required, and reporting. We think various vendors will have their own e-commerce platforms, and marketing/advertising platforms as well. We need to embrace and standardize the user experience when we can, so that the user has a clear and consistent purchase experience. 

Every commit must be fully tested and commented, contain a full suite of regression test cases, use clear english in all naming, and be object-oriented.
As a citizen and as a service based in the United States of America, this metaverse is governed by all its laws and regulations. 
I welcome your contributions, and promise to be fair to everyone. Let's create something historic!

mth199/metaverse,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

nicochirichella/metaverse,TypeScript,"# Users Tracker

This is a simple server to track friendships of users and extract some analytics from them. It's implemented with ExpressJS + Typescript + pg-promise for persistance.

## Running the server

NodeJS is needed to compile & run the server. It has been tested with version 14.17.1, though other versions may work too.

Once NodeJS is installed, remember to run `npm install` in the `server` folder.

### Running the database

This server needs a PostgreSQL database running to work. It has been tested with Postgres 12.

The easiest way to run the database is to use docker. If you have docker installed, you can run `npm run local-db` and it should start a docker container with a Postgres that allows access with the credentials provided in [src/config/db.ts](src/config/db.ts).

To check that the container was started correctly, you can run `docker ps`. You should see a container named ""postgres"".

### Starting the server

Once the database is running, `npm run start` can be run to start the server. It should automatically run the migrations and start the server, listening in port 8081.

To test that the server is running correctly, you can go to http://localhost:8081/status.

## Server API

The server currently has three services:
* GET `/status`: Returns server status.
* GET `/friendships`: Return the currently added friendships in the server.
* POST `/friendships/{address1}/{address2}`: Creates a friendship between address 1 and address 2. No need to provide any body in the request.
* POST `/users-update`: Creates a new position in position_history of all users based in a body that containts the status of all the users in the metaverse (connected and disconnected). needs a body like this one: body {
                    ""moved"": [ {
                                ""id"": ""{usserAddress1}"",
                                ""position"": {
                                    ""x"": 3,
                                    ""y"": 5
                                }
                            }...]        
                    ""disconnected"": [""{usserAddress}""...]
                } 
* GET `/suggest-friendship/{address1}/{address2}`: return if we should suggest a friendship between 2 addresses that are not currently friends. Will return TRUE if in the last 2 hours there was a moment with a group of users that were friends among them and created this ""friendship connection"" between address1 and address2.

To create friendships for testing, you can use any tool that can perform a `POST`.

A Postman collection is provided in the [postman](postman) folder. You can import it to test the app more easily.

## Testing

Jest is used to write and run tests.

You can do `npm run test` to run the tests. Any file in the [test](test) folder that ends with `.spec.ts` will be considered for testing. If you need to add tests, you can add them following that convention.

Only unit tests infrastructure is provided. No need to add integration testing.

## Migrations

Database Migrations are stored in the [src/migrations/scripts](src/migrations/scripts). [node-pg-migrate](https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate) is used for this purpose.

If there's a need to modify the database, migrations should be added to ensure that the data model can be replicated everywhere.

### Creating a migration

You can run `npm run migrate create {MIGRATION_NAME}` to create a migration. It should be automatically added to the correct folder.

### Running migrations

Migrations are run automatically when the server is started. If you need to run them manually, you can run:

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:12345678@localhost:5432/users_tracker npm run migrate up`

Replacing `DATABASE_URL` with a valid url if the credentials are different than the default.

### Reverting migrations

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:12345678@localhost:5432/users_tracker npm run migrate down`

"
LeeHoanMinh/Metaverse,C#,"# Unity + Git + Git LFS

This is a tutorial & template for setting up Unity + Git + Git Large File Storage (LFS). 

There are a couple of challenges when it comes to using git (or version control software in general) with Unity:

- Binary assets - commit history, merge conflicts, etc. are near impossible for a human to read. We can solve this by serializing assets, e.g. turning Unity scenes into a text format.
- Large files (large 3D models, big spritesheets, etc.) - GitHub warns you at 50mb and caps you at 100mb. We can solve this with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Initial Setup

The initial setup for a project requires a few steps, but you only have to do it once per project. To set up a Unity project with Git and Git LFS:

### Preparing your Computer

- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
- Install the required software on your machine:
  - [Unity](https://unity.com/).
  - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
  - [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com).
  - If you are in the IAM labs/classrooms, these should be installed. You may need to open the software center to activate GitHub Desktop.
- Open up GitHub Desktop and login in with your GitHub account.

### Creating the Repository

You can watch a video of this process [here](https://colum2.instructuremedia.com/embed/de36691b-707a-4877-910c-e25b0f0d45aa), or follow along below:

- Create a new repository for your project from GitHub Desktop:
  - `File > New Repository` or `CTRL + N`.
  - Give it a name and choose the local path where it will be created. (If you are in an IAM lab/classroom, do NOT put it on the network home drive AKA z drive.)
- Add the .gitignore and .gitattributes:
  - [Download the files](https://github.com/mikewesthad/unity-git-and-lfs/archive/master.zip) from this repo.
  - Unzip the files and copy over the .gitignore and .gitattributes files to your git repository.
  - Create a commit from GitHub Desktop with those two files.
  - It's important that you do this step first before adding any Unity project files.
- Set up Git LFS:
  - Navigate to your repository and run `git lfs install` in your command prompt/terminal. If you have your repository selected in GitHub Desktop, you can click `Repository > Open in Command Prompt` from the toolbar to open up a terminal window. Type in `git lfs install` and hit enter. You should see a message like ""Git LFS initialized"".
- Add your Unity project to the repository:
  - Create a new Unity project or grab an existing project.
  - Open up your Unity project folder in file explorer/finder. It's the folder that contains ""Assets/"", ""ProjectSettings/"", ""Packages/"", etc. In other words, select the folder one directory up from ""Assets/"". One quick way to get there from Unity, right click on ""Assets"" in your Project window and select ""Show in Explorer"".
  - Copy all the contents of your project folder into your repository (e.g. ""Assets/"", ""ProjectSettings/"", etc.).
- Make a commit of the project:
  - Head back to GitHub desktop.
  - Select your files and make a commit.
- Publish your repository:
  - Head to GitHub Desktop and select your repository.
  - Click the ""Publish repository"" button near the top of the screen.
  - If you are creating this repository for a project in class, uncheck ""Keep this code private"".
  - Click ""Publish repository"".
  - Whew! It's live now. You go straight to where it is stored on GitHub via `Repository > View on GitHub` in the GitHub Desktop toolbar.

Now that the repository is all set up, you can simply commit and push/pull as you work on the project! Make sure to always commit and sync before leaving the lab.

## Cloning the Repository Elsewhere

Now that you've got this Unity project on GitHub, you can ""clone"" it to a new computer:

- Make sure you have GitHub Desktop + Git LFS + Unity on the computer.
- Open GitHub Desktop and log in.
- Click on `File => Clone Repository..."" (or CTRL + SHIFT + O). Choose the repository and the local path where it should be cloned on the computer.
- GitHub Desktop may prompt you to install Git LFS. If it does, allow it. If it doesn't, repeat the process from the previous section where we ran `git lfs install` from a terminal window.

## Notes

One thing to note, the free plan of Git LFS comes with 1g of storage total and 1g of bandwidth per billing cycle/month. Anything you push/pull from LFS counts against that. You can see your current usage under `Settings > Billing`.

[Metaverse1](http://www.metaverse1.org/) was a three year ITEA2 research project, carried out between 2008 and 2011. The project goal was the creation of standards for the interaction between virtual worlds and the real world and the project culminated in the creation of the MPEG-V standard.

This repository contains code and documentation for the soundscape rendering application developed at the [Music Technology Group](http://mtg.upf.edu) for a virtual tourism use case within the Metaverse1 project. The soundscape rendering application was developed in SuperCollider, and the audio streaming server was programmed in Twisted/Python.

The system is a soundscape composition and rendering environment based on a generative graph based model of sound concepts. The code is provided mostly for archival and documentation purposes, in case it is interesting and useful for someone.

Documentation is scarce; if you have any questions or suggestions, please submit an issue in our issue tracker!

## Documentation

# 🤺 Metaverse of World

As in others, players control an NFT within a world quests in a third person view (with the option to play in first person) exploring the environment, fighting various monsters and players, completing and interacting with non-playable characters (NPCs). ) or other players. Completing missions will help players to level up and in this way, they will be able to get equipment that will help them later to fight the different creatures that appear on their way.

Tools to deploy your own Immers Space destination in the federated metaverse.

There are two parts that make up an immer.
1. Your Immersive Web experience.
Immers Space is designed to work across platforms and engines with any experience.
2. The immers social networking server.
This is what connects your experience with the metaverse and allows immersers from other immers to bring their identity, avatars, and friends to your destination.

There are two sets of tools and instructions here to choose from depending on your Immersive Web experience.

## I have a custom Immersive Web Experience

[Go to the immers folder for tools to deploy just the immers server](./immers)

## I want to use Immers Space with Mozilla Hubs Cloud

[Go to the immers-hubs folder for tools to deploy the immers server and integrate with Hubs](./immers-hubs)

mrkbot/metaverse,,
nicochirichella/metaverse,TypeScript,"# Users Tracker

This is a simple server to track friendships of users and extract some analytics from them. It's implemented with ExpressJS + Typescript + pg-promise for persistance.

## Running the server

NodeJS is needed to compile & run the server. It has been tested with version 14.17.1, though other versions may work too.

Once NodeJS is installed, remember to run `npm install` in the `server` folder.

### Running the database

This server needs a PostgreSQL database running to work. It has been tested with Postgres 12.

The easiest way to run the database is to use docker. If you have docker installed, you can run `npm run local-db` and it should start a docker container with a Postgres that allows access with the credentials provided in [src/config/db.ts](src/config/db.ts).

To check that the container was started correctly, you can run `docker ps`. You should see a container named ""postgres"".

### Starting the server

Once the database is running, `npm run start` can be run to start the server. It should automatically run the migrations and start the server, listening in port 8081.

To test that the server is running correctly, you can go to http://localhost:8081/status.

## Server API

The server currently has three services:
* GET `/status`: Returns server status.
* GET `/friendships`: Return the currently added friendships in the server.
* POST `/friendships/{address1}/{address2}`: Creates a friendship between address 1 and address 2. No need to provide any body in the request.
* POST `/users-update`: Creates a new position in position_history of all users based in a body that containts the status of all the users in the metaverse (connected and disconnected). needs a body like this one: body {
                    ""moved"": [ {
                                ""id"": ""{usserAddress1}"",
                                ""position"": {
                                    ""x"": 3,
                                    ""y"": 5
                                }
                            }...]        
                    ""disconnected"": [""{usserAddress}""...]
                } 
* GET `/suggest-friendship/{address1}/{address2}`: return if we should suggest a friendship between 2 addresses that are not currently friends. Will return TRUE if in the last 2 hours there was a moment with a group of users that were friends among them and created this ""friendship connection"" between address1 and address2.

To create friendships for testing, you can use any tool that can perform a `POST`.

A Postman collection is provided in the [postman](postman) folder. You can import it to test the app more easily.

## Testing

Jest is used to write and run tests.

You can do `npm run test` to run the tests. Any file in the [test](test) folder that ends with `.spec.ts` will be considered for testing. If you need to add tests, you can add them following that convention.

Only unit tests infrastructure is provided. No need to add integration testing.

## Migrations

Database Migrations are stored in the [src/migrations/scripts](src/migrations/scripts). [node-pg-migrate](https://github.com/salsita/node-pg-migrate) is used for this purpose.

If there's a need to modify the database, migrations should be added to ensure that the data model can be replicated everywhere.

### Creating a migration

You can run `npm run migrate create {MIGRATION_NAME}` to create a migration. It should be automatically added to the correct folder.

### Running migrations

Migrations are run automatically when the server is started. If you need to run them manually, you can run:

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:12345678@localhost:5432/users_tracker npm run migrate up`

Replacing `DATABASE_URL` with a valid url if the credentials are different than the default.

### Reverting migrations

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:12345678@localhost:5432/users_tracker npm run migrate down`

A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social connection. 
In futurism and science fiction, the term is often described as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and augmented reality headsets.

#### Web 3.0 
Is a digital place where we can produce content, share it, and formalize deals. Users will be able to interact with data through artificial intelligence and machine learning technology.

### Content components

**Path:** `components/stories`

You can easily change all the content displayed on the site in the stories react components.

For your convenience, I have already filled the stories with example content.



### Color theme

**File:** `styles/variables.module.scss`

You can easily choose the colors for the site by editing the SCSS variables (`$primary-color`, `$accent-color`). Be aware of accessibility and set colors that are contrasting enough for white text.



### Fonts

**Files:** `styles/globals.scss`, `pages/_document.tsx`

First of all, connect the fonts you need in the file `pages/_document.tsx`.

Next, you need to update CSS variables (`--base-font`, `--accent-font`) by specifying font information in the file `styles/globals.scss`



## Deploy (installation) guide <a id=""deploy"" href=""#deploy"">#</a> 

**Requirements:** 
    Node.js 12.22.0 or later; 
    MacOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported;

Below is the documentation from the official website Next.js <a href=""https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment"">(see original)</a>.

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the <a href=""https://vercel.com/"">Vercel platform</a> from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites, hybrid apps, and Serverless Functions.

#### Getting started

If you haven’t already done so, push your app to a Git provider of your choice: GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Your repository can be private or public.


Then, follow these steps:

1. Sign up to Vercel (no credit card is required).
1. After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).
1. Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work fine!
1. After importing, it’ll deploy your app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.

Congratulations! You’ve deployed your app! If you have questions, take a look at the Vercel documentation.


### Static website generation

To generate a static HTML site run commands:

```bash
yarn install;
echo ""UNOPTIMIZED_IMAGES=true"" >> .env;
yarn build;
yarn export;
```

The ""out"" folder will be generated.

### Node.js Server

`next build` builds the production application in the .next folder. After building, `next start` starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages.




### Docker Image

Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Docker containers. You can use this approach when deploying to container orchestrators such as Kubernetes or HashiCorp Nomad, or when running inside a single node in any cloud provider.

Dockerfile is already included in the project

You can build your container with `docker build . -t my-next-js-app` and run it with `docker run -p 3000:3000 my-next-js-app`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Introdução

A realidade virtual é uma ferramenta com bastante potencial para ser empregada no ensino de ciências, despertando o interesse de alunos por fenômenos que muitas vezes são representados de forma abstrata e não são fáceis de serem visualizados. No campo da Biologia não é diferente, tendo aplicações práticas desde cirurgias já realizadas com realidade aumentada, até o auxílio na aprendizagem através de modelos anatômicos 3D[1]. Ainda falando sobre a realidade virtual, o uso da tecnologia já é uma realidade em museus de todo o mundo, trazendo uma experiência ainda mais detalhista e enriquecedora para seus visitantes. Em Salvador, o Espaço Pierre Verger da Fotografia Baiana (Forte de Sta. Maria), traz diversas exposições que aconteceram ou que foram criadas especificamente para visitação através de Óculos de Realidade Virtual[2]. Mostras de Pierre Verger, Adenor Gondim e Hirosuke Kitamura, foram as primeiras a serem disponibilizadas ao público. Nesse contexto, surge a ideia do museu de cera da anatomia humana. Um espaço interativo que se propõe a utilizar a realidade virtual para trazer uma experiência realista a crianças de 6-10 anos que ainda estão tendo o seu primeiro contato com os órgãos do corpo humano, ajudando a despertar mais interesse e retratar de forma mais realista e potencializando o aprendizado.
A ideia é um aplicativo multiplataforma que não precisa de equipamentos de hardware sofisticados para ser utilizado. Um óculos VR Cardboard de papelão(Figura 1), que pode ser feito com o próprio smartphone ou adquirido por até R$ 20.00 nas lojas de varejo online[3], é suficiente para a experiência de imersão no museu. O museu conta com um acervo de 9 peças realistas da anatomia humana, das quais se destacam a reprodução do cérebro humano, detalhes do esqueleto dentre outros. O tour virtual foi pensado como uma experiência de imersão, sendo também possível utilizar seus óculos RV para visualizar outras perspectivas do ambiente.

# Técnicas Aplicadas

O museu foi construído utilizando o three.js[4], uma biblioteca JavaScript apoiada no WebGL que é bastante utilizada para criar e modelar objetos 3D e animações em um navegador web. A ferramenta foi escolhida pois além de ser open-source e ter uma boa documentação, tem suporte para o Webxr, permitindo a integração com o metaverso.

**1) Modelagem do Ambiente**

Para a construção do teto e do piso do nosso ambiente utilizamos duas instâncias do objeto do tipo THREE.PlaneGeometry, definindo o tamanho, rotacionando, transladando e adicionando cores nas posições dessa geometria. Carregamos uma textura e adicionamos a um THREE.MeshPhongMaterial e posteriormente adicionando a nossa cena um objeto do tipo THREE.Mesh, que foi instanciado passando essa geometria e o seu material.
Criamos uma matriz para definir em quais posições teríamos paredes, janelas ou a base utilizada para posicionarmos os órgãos. Para a criação das paredes, adicionamos à cena um THREE.Mesh composto por um THREE.BoxGeometry e um THREE.MeshPhongMaterial, carregando uma textura de mármore. Já para a criação das bases, adicionamos um THREE.Mesh composto por um THREE.BoxGeometry e um THREE.MeshPhongMaterial, carregando uma textura metalizada. Na criação das janelas adicionamos um THREE.Mesh composto por um  THREE.BoxGeometry e utilizamos um THREE.MeshBasicMaterial de cor ciano, transparente e opacidade baixa. A construção em formato de matriz foi escolhida pela versatilidade de adequação ao longo do projeto.

**2) Modelagem dos Órgãos**

Os orgãos foram adicionados através de modelos disponibilizados de forma gratuita no formato GLTF em plataformas como o Sketchfab[5]. A escolha de trabalhar prioritariamente com modelos do tipo GLTF foi por conta da simplicidade e da maior disponibilidade destes em relação aos OBJ. Com o cenário já construido, foi possível modificar a escala e a posição de cada órgão para dimensionar de forma real dentro do museu.

**3) Modelagem do Cenário**

Os objetos que compõem o cenário também foram adicionados através de modelos disponibilizados gratuitamente em formato GLTF em plataformas como o Sketchfab. Com o cenário já construído, adicionamos todos os objetos através de uma instância de um objeto do tipo GLTFLoader, no qual passamos o caminho do modelo baixado em nosso projeto e uma função para definirmos a posição, tamanho, nome e posteriormente a adição à cena. O GLTFLoader foi constrúido para evitar redundância no código.

**4) Iluminação da Cena**

Para a iluminação da cena do nosso projeto, adicionamos uma luz ambiente e três pontos de luz, duas posicionadas no lustre adicionado no teto do cenário e uma posicionada em uma luminária em cima da mesa. Para a luz ambiente instanciamos um objeto do tipo THREE.AmbientLight e para os pontos de luz adicionais, três instâncias de objetos do tipo THREE.PointLight. A escolha da iluminação do tipo THREE.PointLight, como o próprio nome diz, por ser um ponto de luz, assim podemos posicionar cada ponto estrategicamente para que cause a impressão de ser uma luz proveniente dos objetos citados acima, e por podermos definir/modificar a distância, decaimento e intensidade da iluminação.

**5) Integração com o Webxr - Realidade Virtual**

O WebXR[6] foi a ferramenta utilizada para que fosse possivel exibir o cenário do museu através do navegador, simulando a utilização de um dispositivo físico como por exemplo um óculos Cardboad, através da instalação de um plugin no browser. 

Através do Threejs, foi necessário importar o VRButton que é um botão que verifica se existe compatibilidade com VR e que caso a mesma exista, é através deste que a experiencia em VR é iniciada. No nosso museu, o tour também é iniciado dessa forma. Para isso, foi necessário ajustar também no código na função responsável pela animação, utilizando setAnimationLoop pois o mesmo é necessário para projetos com WebXR, além de ativar a flag de renderização XR.

A experiência de realidade virtual é uma imersão no metaverso através de um caminho predefinido que a câmera percorre no museu. Para isso, adicionamos ela a um grupo(THREE.Group) e construímos uma elipse que vai ser o caminho percorrido pela câmera em cada ciclo da animação. Durante o tour, é possível utilizar os óculos de realidade virtual para observar em qualquer direção do ambiente. A escolha por uma interação visual se deu por conta do custo do equipamento exigido para outras formas de interação utilizando os controles, além do tempo reduzido de aproximadamente 15 dias para entregar o projeto piloto 100% funcional.

HeroMetaverse/MetaverseDaoNFT,JavaScript,"# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
node scripts/deploy.js
npx eslint '**/*.js'
npx eslint '**/*.js' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/deploy.js
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS ""Hello, Hardhat!""
```

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## A Framework for testing Cognitive Agents in a variety of virtual environments

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/CyberChad/Metaverse/wiki) for more information.

The Metaverse repository is dedicated to the development of a framework to support the empirical evaluation of intelligent cognitive agents that are based on the Common Model of Cognition. The framework is divided into two interrelated sub-systems; the MetaMind, and the Multiverse. 

**MetaMind** is an abstract interface for common cognitive architectures that conform to most or all of the Common Model. Supported architectures currently include ACT-R, SOAR, and Sigma. 

**Multiverse** is an abstract interface for a multitude of virtual environments that support the training and testing of intelligent agents. Supported environments include OpenAI Gym, and Starcraft 2.

These two subsystems are tied together by a common graphical interface to run experiments with various combinations of architectures and environments, and to measure the interface points within each agent, and the overall effects on external performance.

Metaverse-Association/fund,,"# Metaverse Association - Non-profit Foundation for the Open Metaverse: PROJECT ON HOLD
###### tags: `fund`

[![hackmd-github-sync-badge](https://hackmd.io/RoZWsipiSDKNDy1CyIqifQ/badge)](https://hackmd.io/RoZWsipiSDKNDy1CyIqifQ)

###### Note: This project is on hold. If you would like to assist or help lead this effort please reach out. People care about the problem we are hoping to solve, but it would need more effort than we can currently provide. Ideally, we can resume this in the near future, but we don't want to bottleneck this effort. Cheers, and let's make the Metaverse open, together. 

The Metaverse Association is a traditional non-profit foundation that funds open metaverse project    s, and collaborates with web3 and web2 communities.

We believe the open metaverse represents one of the largest social changes that will happen in our lifetime. It is imperative that it is open, interoperable, and that the foundational principles target positive outcomes for society. 

There is a massive gap in our industry related to funding sources for Open Metaverse creators. Many open metaverse creators creating critical infrastructure lack a current path to revenue, and we don't want them to fizzle out. While we recognize that blockchain is an important component of the open metaverse, it is not all inclusive. In order to represent all of the critical needs of the Metaverse, funding access should be open and accessible by anyone. 

It is our belief that the open Metaverse is dependent on collaboration. We do not aspire to be a single institution, but actually work alongside the different stakeholders, because we all ultimately share the same vision. 

## Getting Involved 

This is a new repo, meant to serve as a clean slate. We rally around [milestones](https://github.com/Metaverse-Association/fund/milestones), and [feedback discussions](https://github.com/Metaverse-Association/feedback/discussions) Let's shape this association together, as a collective. We don't know what we don't know, and hope you'll help us make this group impactful and collaborative. For now, we have adopted the [OMI Github Strategy](https://hackmd.io/@mrmetaverse/omi-github-process) which once ratified as a group, we can create our own. 

## Getting Funded 

We are a new org, but we hope to serve the Metaverse quickly. We want to support people building for an Open and Interoperable Metaverse. To submit a funding request for review, please review: [Our Guidelines: What we are looking to fund]() for more information for how to qualify. More information about when, and how to come. 

## Raising Funds 

We opted to start as a traditional non-profit foundation. We believe that open metaverse creators deserve a chance to build out the critical infrastructure necessary for a more collaborative and open metaverse. We don't believe that should solely be driven by immediate profitability. We all benefit from interoperability and the open metaverse. That is why we intend to create avenues for traditional funds to get involved with supporting these projects. We intend to roll out new orgs and services in the future to help creators with a path to profitability scale as needed, and to help those without a path to profitability to succeed as intended. The metaverse is bigger than one org. 

## What we are not 

The Metaverse Association is not a DAO. We are not owned by a larger corp, nor are we a standards body. While we work well with these other groups, the Metaverse Association is strictly intended to serve as a more traditional non-profit issuing grants for the open metaverse.

"
chouaibmajid/metaverse,CSS,"This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

tzmos/Metaverse3d,JavaScript,"# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## 팀명: 소소일상
모델링: 김상원, 정태원
개발: 안세윤, 우영재

## 프로젝트 개요

한양대학교 ERICA의 홍보관인 '아고라'를 가상공간에 구현함으로서, 재학생들에게 잘 알려지지 않았던 공간을 재활성화 시키고, 외부 방문객들의 지리적 한계를 극복하고 오직 메타버스에서만 겪을 수 있는 체험을 통해 본래 아고라의 목적이었던 홍보 기능을 극대화하고자 한다.

## 프로젝트 개발 계획

[아고라 가상현실 구현] 
- 사용자 캐릭터, 카메라 움직이면서 진행

[3D Media Gallery(지하 1층)] 
- 한양대 에리카 캠퍼스를 축소한 3D 조감도를 설치
- 방문자가 에리카의 모습을 한눈에 보고, 관찰할 수 있게 확대 및 축소, 회전 기능을 구현. 
- 조감도를 관찰 중 궁금한 건물, 위치가 있으면 해당 지점의 상세사항을 볼 수 있도록 구현. 
- 학교 홍보영상 시청 시 영상에서 홍보하고 있는 해당 구역을 조감도에 표시
- 각 건물, 동을 확인할 시 해당 단과대의 홍보 영상을 벽의 스크린에서 송출

[Promotion Zone(1층)]
- 외부인과 내부인이 교류할 수 있는 공간으로, private하게 구성. 
- 한양대학교 ERICA 입학을 희망하거나 관심이 있는 외부인과 교내 재학생을 매칭하여
1대 1로 상담을 진행할 수 있는 소규모 공간 여러 개로 구성
- 3회차에 학습하는 포톤 클라우드를 활용하여 외부인과 내부인의 멀티플레이가 가능하도록 구현

[History Gallery (벽체 공간)]
- 1층 한양대 에리카 설립 역사로 시작해 계단을 오를수록 현재에 가까운 역사를 벽에 구현. 캐릭터가 역사 이미지에 상호작용(클릭, 터치) 시 해당 역사 안내

[E.R.I.C.A Gallery (2-3층)]
- 2층 전체 바닥을 상공에서 내려 본 캠퍼스로 심플하게 구현. 상호작용 시 해당 위치의 다수의 사진을 모자이크 스크린에 보여줌
- 3층에는 안내 캐릭터가 등장해 학연산 클러스터 인프라, ERICA의 다양한 통계자료 소개. 소개는 AI 내레이션으로 구현
 
[Game Zone (4층)] 
- “숨은 하냥이 찾기” 게임 구현. 유저들의 시간 기록을 스코어보드 형식으로 벽에 게시

[Sky Hall (5층)] 
- 기존의 휴게, 스터디 공간 대신 높은 위치에서 캠퍼스를 조망할 수 있는 공간
- 아트웍 상징 조형물 구현. 상호작용 시 확대, 포커싱되고 해당 조형물에 대한 설명 안내됨

🖼 Embedding Your Docsify Page Content into Other Systems
---  

![ Docsify Open Publishing Page Ready for Embedding](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulhibbitts/github-repo-images/master/docsify-op-ready-for-embedding.png)
_Figure 2. Docsify Open Publishing page ready for embedding_

The optional ‘embedded’ (all lowercase) URL parameter hides a site’s sidebar and optional navbar for seamlessly embedding Docsify page content within another platform such as Canvas LMS, Moodle, Microsoft Teams etc.

To only display Docsify page content, add the following to a Docsify page URL:

`?embedded=true`

For example, https://hibbitts-design.github.io/demo-docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/#/chapter-1/introduction would display a standard Docsify page while https://hibbitts-design.github.io/demo-docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/#/chapter-1/introduction?embedded=true would only display page content (i.e., no sidebar or optional navbar is shown).

To optionally hide the 'Edit this Page' link, use the following:

`?embedded=true&hidegitlink=true`

For example, https://hibbitts-design.github.io/demo-docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/#/chapter-1/introduction would display a standard Docsify page while https://hibbitts-design.github.io/demo-docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/#/chapter-1/introduction?embedded=true&hidegitlink=true would only display page content (i.e., no sidebar or optional navbar is shown) and also hide the 'Edit this Page' link.

elston0831/metaverse,,
idirall22/metaverse,TypeScript,"# Advanced Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem.

The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. It also comes with a variety of other tools, preconfigured to work with the project code.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
TS_NODE_FILES=true npx ts-node scripts/deploy.ts
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}'
npx eslint '**/*.{js,ts}' --fix
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --check
npx prettier '**/*.{json,sol,md}' --write
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol'
npx solhint 'contracts/**/*.sol' --fix
```

# Etherscan verification

To try out Etherscan verification, you first need to deploy a contract to an Ethereum network that's supported by Etherscan, such as Ropsten.

In this project, copy the .env.example file to a file named .env, and then edit it to fill in the details. Enter your Etherscan API key, your Ropsten node URL (eg from Alchemy), and the private key of the account which will send the deployment transaction. With a valid .env file in place, first deploy your contract:

```shell
hardhat run --network ropsten scripts/sample-script.ts
```

Then, copy the deployment address and paste it in to replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in this command:

```shell
npx hardhat verify --network ropsten DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS ""Hello, Hardhat!""
```

# Performance optimizations

For faster runs of your tests and scripts, consider skipping ts-node's type checking by setting the environment variable `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY` to `1` in hardhat's environment. For more details see [the documentation](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#performance-optimizations).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

JTStephens18/metaverse,JavaScript,"I wanted to dive into how a metaverse was created. The two main tools I used were Solidity and React.js. I utilized Three.js for the 3D plane and environment. Ganache and Truffle assisted me in running and testing it on my local machine. 

---

Once the application loads the following is what is seen. There is a blank 3D environment until the user connects their account via MetaMask. 

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 131031](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90572944/169655539-95884156-6606-4f98-b84f-17a47c804aad.png)

---

The green plots of land are displayed once an account is connected. You can see which account you are currently using via the navbar. 
Users can click on each of the green plots of land to display information such as the name, owner, ID, and cost.

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 132615](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90572944/169655544-887c644e-44a8-4858-bc0e-a2869d629d4b.png)

---

If the land is not owned, then the user can purchase the property if they have enough funds in their account. 
If it is owned, then all the user can do is view the property's attributes. 

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 132630](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90572944/169655568-fbc8a7e0-375b-4b16-a6d1-42698435085f.png)

---

The following images show what occurs when the user decides to buy a property. 

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 132650](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90572944/169655583-cc779415-0c01-4970-b747-f2de571f9167.png)

---

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 132706](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90572944/169655587-5479ec94-35ad-4f2a-a094-adbbd05e3cf9.png)

---

Now we can see that the property is owned. If a different account selects this property all they will see is the account that owns it. 

![Screenshot 2022-05-02 132720](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90572944/169655594-9b9e8c14-dc96-4e1a-b6f6-d82c0bd5e40a.png)

------

## VPS 필수 파일 설치

VPSData_(xxx).zip를 Project Folder 와 동일한 폴더에 풉니다. Unity(Project Name)/../VPSData/VPSSimulationData 이런식의 구조가 되어야 합니다.

<img src=""VPSSDK.assets/image-20210716132839590.png"" alt=""image-20210716132839590"" style=""zoom:50%;"" />

------

##  사용 방법

-  Asset/Scene/Scenes/MaxstScene.unity을 선택합니다. 

* Hierarchy에서 VPSStudio를 선택합니다.
* VPS Map에서 시뮬레이션을 할 맵을 선택합니다.
* VPS Simulation Data에서 사용하고 싶은 시뮬레이션 데이터를 선택합니다.(다른 데이터를 선택하시면 다른 시뮬레이팅된 화면이 나타납니다.)
* Load VPS Map을 클릭해서 해당 맵에 대한 정보를 불러옵니다.
* VPS 맵이 생성 되고 카메라가 표시됩니다.
* <img src=""VPSSDK.assets/image-20210906221917101.png"" alt=""image-20210906221917101"" style=""zoom:50%;"" />

------

## 저작 방법

- Hierarchy에 Trackable 하위에 장소의 메쉬 컨텐츠가 존재합니다.
- 각 장소에 맞는 Trackable 하위에 컨텐츠를 배치하여야 제대로 인식이 가능 합니다.**(각 장소의 이름은 메쉬와 Trackable 속성에 있습니다.)**
- 각각의 Trackable 하위 GameObject의 Position을 변경하여 재배치 하면 됩니다,
- 재배치된 컨텐츠를 Play버튼을 누르면 시뮬레이터 데이터가 로드 되면서 컨텐츠가 실제 화면에서 어떻게 증강 되는지 보여지게 됩니다.
- 인식 위치에 따라서 각각의 Trackable이 **Active**되게 됩니다.

## ReferenceCamera 이용 방법.

VPSStudio에서 해당 VPS Map을 선택하고 Load VPS Map을 클릭하면 맵의 학습 시점의 카메라가 VPSStudio하위에 생성 됩니다.

<img src=""VPSSDK.assets/image-20210906222106021.png"" alt=""image-20210906222106021"" style=""zoom:50%;"" />

하위에 생성된 카메라 그룹을 선택하거나 Game View에서 카메라를 선택하고 하위의 ReferenceCamera를 선택하면 Game View에 학습 시점에 이미지와 함께 컨텐츠가 어떻게 배치 되는지 확인 할 수 있습니다.

<img src=""VPSSDK.assets/image-20210906222134395.png"" alt=""image-20210906222134395"" style=""zoom:50%;"" />

<img src=""VPSSDK.assets/image-20210906222211011.png"" alt=""image-20210906222211011"" style=""zoom:50%;"" />

해당 위치의 Trackable 하위에 컨텐츠를 배치하고 위치를 이동 시키면서 실제 배치가 어떻게 될지 확인 합니다.

------

## Occlusion 기능

- Occlusion 기능을 사용하고 싶으시면, Hierarchy에서 SceneManager에 Occlusion Objects에 컨텐츠를 추가하면 됩니다. Occlusion Objects 컨텐츠는 런타임 시점에 모두 투명 처리가 되는 Material로 변경 됩니다.
- Occlusion 기능 실행하고 싶지 않으시면, SceneManager에 IsOcclusion을 uncheck하면 됩니다. 다만 Occlusion을 적용하지 않으면 해당 위치의 Mesh가 보여지게 됩니다.

------

## 네비게이션 기능

- 네비게이션은 SceneManager GameObject에 포함되어 있습니다. 화살표의 거리, 화살표가 보이는 거리, 화살표의 기본 높이, 화살표의 prefab이 속성입니다. 화살표 prefab은 변경 가능 합니다.

![image-20210807112902560](VPSSDK.assets/image-20210807112902560-8303344.png)

- NavigationController의 MakePath 함수를 사용해서 네비게이션 경로가 생성 됩니다. 

```c#
MakePath(string start_location, Vector3 start_position, string end_location, Vector3 end_position, VPSTrackable[] trackables, string serverName = """")
```

- start_location : 현재 Trackable의 위치 입니다.
- start_position : 현재 Trackable의 위치의 3차원 좌표 입니다. 기본적으로 ARCamera의 position 좌표를 사용합니다.
- end_location : 목적지의 Trackable의 위치 입니다. 코엑스에서는 1층, 지하1층, 지하 2층, 실외로 지정됩니다.
- end_position : 목적지의 3차원 좌표 입니다. 해당 목적지의 위치와 좌표가 맞아야 합니다.
- serverName : 네비게이션을 찾기위한 서버를 지정해야할 경우 사용합니다.

------

## 주의사항

- MacOS에서 작업하실경우 현재 Unity에서 Nortarization을 제공하지 않아 플러그인이 제대로 작동하지 않습니다. 아래의 명령으로 GateKeeper를 해제 하셔야합니다.

```
cd Assets/MaxstAR/Plugins

xattr -cr MaxstAR.bundle

sudo spctl —master-disable
```

- Android에서는 카메라와 위치 권한이 필요합니다. AndroidManifest.xml를 참고하시길 바랍니다.  Android OS 8(오레오) 이상이면 해당 프로젝트에서 안드로이드 퍼미션을 얻으셔야합니다. 현재는 아래의 코드로 권한을 얻습니다.

```c#
AndroidRuntimePermissions.Permission[] result = AndroidRuntimePermissions.RequestPermissions(""android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"", ""android.permission.CAMERA"", ""android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"", ""android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"");
```

-  https문제로 AndroidManifest.xml에 아래 코드를 추가하셔야 합니다.

  ```
  android:usesCleartextTraffic=“true” 
  ```

- iOS에서도 또한 위치와 카메라 권한을 요구합니다.

  Info.plist에 Privacy - Location에 관련된 권한을 모두 얻어야합니다.**(Location 권한을 얻지 못하면 GPS 좌표를 얻지 못합니다.)**

- **인식에는 인터넷이 필요합니다.** SDK가 빌드된 폰에 인터넷이 작동하는지 확인해 주세요.

------

## VPS시작

VPS SDK는 카메라와 TrackerManager의 시작이 있어야 작동이 됩니다.

```c#
if (Application.platform == RuntimePlatform.OSXEditor || Application.platform == RuntimePlatform.WindowsEditor)
{
    string simulatePath = vPSStudioController.vpsSimulatePath;
    if (Directory.Exists(simulatePath))
    {
        CameraDevice.GetInstance().Start(simulatePath);
        MaxstAR.SetScreenOrientation((int)ScreenOrientation.Portrait);
    }
}
else
{
    if (CameraDevice.GetInstance().IsFusionSupported(CameraDevice.FusionType.ARCamera))
    {
        CameraDevice.GetInstance().Start();
    }
    else
    {
        TrackerManager.GetInstance().RequestARCoreApk();
    }
}

TrackerManager.GetInstance().StartTracker();
}
```

카메라를 시작하는 코드는 아래와 같습니다.

```c#
CameraDevice.GetInstance().Start();
```

시뮬레이션 카메라를 시작하는 코드는 아래와 같습니다. 시뮬레이션 카메라는 VPSCollector를 기반으로 만들어진 데이터의 위치를 Path로 전달해 주어야 합니다.

```c#
CameraDevice.GetInstance().Start(simulatePath);
```

VPS의 엔진을 시작하는 코드는 아래와 같습니다.

```c#
TrackerManager.GetInstance().StartTracker();
```

------

## VPS 데이터 갱신

VPS에 대한 결과물은 Update 함수에서 갱신이 됩니다. openGL thread를 이용하려는 목적이 있습니다.

```c#
TrackerManager.GetInstance().UpdateFrame();
```

UpdateFrame 함수를 통해서 카메라의 포지션과 VPS에 관련된 데이터를 ARFrame에 저장합니다.

### ARFrame

ARFrame 클래스는 VPS의 인식으로 인해 얻어진 데이터를 담고 있습니다.

- GetTrackedImage() 를 통해서 이미지를 얻어내게 됩니다. 
- GetARLocationRecognitionState() 를 통해서 인식 상태를 얻어냅니다. 
- GetARTrackingState() 를 통해서 ARCore, ARKit의 트래킹 상태 여부를 얻습니다.
- GetARTrackingFailureReason() 를 통해서 ARCore, ARKit이 작동 되지 않는 이유를 얻을 수 있습니다.
- GetTransform() 를 통해서 인식이 완료된 카메라의 위치를 얻을 수 있습니다.
- GetARLocalizerLocation()를 통해서 시뮬레이션 영상이나, 카메라 이미지로 얻어진 인식 위치를 전달합니다.

### 인식과 Trackable

```c#
if(arFrame.GetARLocationRecognitionState() == ARLocationRecognitionState.ARLocationRecognitionStateNormal)
{
    Matrix4x4 targetPose = arFrame.GetTransform();

    arCamera.transform.position = MatrixUtils.PositionFromMatrix(targetPose);
    arCamera.transform.rotation = MatrixUtils.QuaternionFromMatrix(targetPose);
    arCamera.transform.localScale = MatrixUtils.ScaleFromMatrix(targetPose);

    string localizerLocation = arFrame.GetARLocalizerLocation();

    if (currentLocalizerLocation != localizerLocation)
    {
        currentLocalizerLocation = localizerLocation;
        foreach (VPSTrackable eachTrackable in vPSTrackablesList)
        {
            bool isLocationInclude = false;
            foreach(string eachLocation in eachTrackable.localizerLocation)
            {
                if(currentLocalizerLocation == eachLocation)
                {
                    isLocationInclude = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            eachTrackable.gameObject.SetActive(isLocationInclude);
        }
    }
}
```

위의 코드는 인식이 완료된 시점에 카메라의 position과 rotation을 적용하는 방법이 있습니다.

인식된 위치를 통해서 해당 VPSTrackable을 선택하여 관련된 컨텐츠를 Active상태로 변경 합니다.

### Navigation

네비게이션 관련된 코드는 아래와 같습니다.

```c#
NavigationController navigationController = vPSStudioController.GetComponent<NavigationController>();
if(currentLocalizerLocation != null)
{
    navigationController.MakePath(currentLocalizerLocation, arCamera.transform.position, ""indoor_maxst_f2"", new Vector3(9.723813f, 0, 10.732927f), vPSTrackablesList.ToArray(),
        ()=> {
            Debug.Log(""No Path"");
    });
}
```

VPSStudio에서 NavigationController를 얻어내서 사용합니다.

NavigationController는 현재 위치를 판단된 상태에서 사용할 수 있습니다. MakePath를 통해서 길을 만들어 냅니다. 길에 대한 정보가 없을 경우 ""No Path""라는 로그를 전달 합니다.

MakePath 함수는 아래와 같습니다.

```c#
public void MakePath(string start_location, Vector3 start_position, string end_location, Vector3 end_position, VPSTrackable[] trackables, Action fail, string serverName = """")
```

네비게이션을 실행 할때는 시작위치와 끝나는 위치 이름과 position을 전달해야 합니다.

## VPSSDK 최적화 방법

1. Camera의 Clipping Planes Near와 Far를 조절합니다.

AbstractARManager.cs

```c#
void OnPreRender()
{
    if (screenWidth != Screen.width || screenHeight != Screen.height)
    {
        screenWidth = Screen.width;
        screenHeight = Screen.height;
        MaxstAR.OnSurfaceChanged(screenWidth, screenHeight);
    }

    if (orientation != Screen.orientation)
    {
        orientation = Screen.orientation;

        if (Application.platform == RuntimePlatform.Android ||
            Application.platform == RuntimePlatform.IPhonePlayer)
        {
            MaxstAR.SetScreenOrientation((int)orientation);
        }
    }

    if (nearClipPlane != arCamera.nearClipPlane || farClipPlane != arCamera.farClipPlane)
    {
        nearClipPlane = arCamera.nearClipPlane;
        farClipPlane = arCamera.farClipPlane;
        CameraDevice.GetInstance().SetClippingPlane(arCamera.nearClipPlane, arCamera.farClipPlane);
    }

    arCamera.projectionMatrix = CameraDevice.GetInstance().GetProjectionMatrix();
}
```

```c#
CameraDevice.GetInstance().SetClippingPlane(arCamera.nearClipPlane, arCamera.farClipPlane);
```

을 통해서 Near와 Far를 조절합니다.
