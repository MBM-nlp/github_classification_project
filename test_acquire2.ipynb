This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RTSlby-l9w) shows you how you can set up WSL. Once you\\'ve installed it, run `wsl` in your terminal to enter Ubuntu, and then run Webaverse from there.\\n\\n## Quickstart\\n\\nStarting the application is as easy as:\\n\\n```sh\\nnpm run start\\n```\\n\\nOnce the server has started up, you can visit `https://local.webaverse.com` \\n\\n## Let\\'s build it together!\\n\\nWe would love for you to come build with us. First, please review the documentation in it\\'s entirety before contributing. Also join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/webaverse) and introduce yourself.\\n\\n##### New Issues and Features\\n\\nPlease search Github issues before reporting a new issue or starting a new feature. If you are starting a new feature or bug fix, please write up or reference an issue and indicate that you are working on it.\\n\\n##### Pull Requests\\n\\nPlease make sure your PRs change as little existing code as is necessary to prevent upstream merge conflicts. When posting a pull request, please document what the PR does and how it can be reviewed and QA\\'d. PRs will be reviewed and accepted if they conform to our linting and code conventions, don\\'t cause any bugs and don\\'t decrease performance of the app.\\n\\n<img align=\"middle\" style=\\'margin: 1em\\' src=\"/docs/town.jpeg\" width=100% />\\n'}]"
